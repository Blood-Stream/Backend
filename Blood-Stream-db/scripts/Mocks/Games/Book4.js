The objective of the game is to score the highest points of all as well as to stop other players from getting higher points by breaking their call (Hence the name Call Break). The points are accumulated in the form of hands. Hand is same as trick in Spades. After the cards are dealt, players make call (bid) in the range of 1-13 hands that they expect to capture based on their cards. Players with several high cards and high number of spades would make a higher call than a player with mostly low cards and less spades cards. The cards are ranked form highest to lowest in the usual way (Ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest). Spades, as said earlier is higher ranked suit. Players try to play trick on other players to make them loose their higher cards. After playing five rounds, a player is declared winner with the highest points. In this version, you will play with three intelligent robot players devised to simulate real-time players. Their playing strategy can be preset from game settings.

For hundreds of years, under the wings of the king and his knights, the people enjoyed times without war. One day, the serenity is shattered, for an evil warlock treads on these lands, bringing with him countless demons and orcs as he watches from his foreboding tower. King Fred Kelsen and his powerful army must clash against this legion, leaving Prince Randhir Kelsen and the kingdom in the hands of his brother - the erudite and famed Regent, Sage Marcus Kelsen.   Alas, the plot thickens. With Regent Marcus in power, his true color emerges; wresting the nations authority, consorting with demons, and eradicating the only obstacle to the throne - Prince Randhir.   Protected by his loyal guard, the prince flees the castle. He must ride to the borders, rally his own band of mercenaries, and embark on the path of vengeance.   \\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606  Our twitter: https://twitter.com/itiangua  Like us: http://www.facebook.com/iTIANGUA  Our website: http://www.itiangua.com/  E-mail: service@itiangua.com', Developer: 'TIANGUA Co.,Ltd', Age_Rating: '9+', Size: 68650227, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heroes-and-castles/id618288607', Name: 'Heroes and Castles', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/eb/bd/37/ebbd3741-d50f-0641-a968-c97560ddf298/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'The Undead Horde and their Orc and Goblin allies are at your castle gates, the King is on the brink of death, and only you stand between the enemy and complete annihilation!

We know that many entrepreneurs started with nothing: Thomas Alva Edison sold snacks and sweets on trains; Rockefeller was the son of a street vendor; Hewlett & Packard started their empire in a garage. And Ferdinando Bocconi, Universit\\xe0 Bocconi\\u2019s founder, began by selling fabrics in the countryside outside of Milan before becoming the forerunner of large retailers in Italy with the opening of the Bocconi Brothers department stores (better known today as \\u201cLa Rinascente\\u201d).  In light of these famous examples, Universit\\xe0 Bocconi has decided to develop a simulation game which gives anyone who is learning about the world of economics for the first time the chance to experiment with the satisfactions and problems small entrepreneurs face on a daily basis as they manage their businesses.  That\\u2019s how ICE \\u2013 Ice Cream Empire \\u2013 was born. Ice Cream Empire helps you learn the rules of the financial market, simulate the running of a business, put your decision-making skills to the test and verify the results of your decisions. Bocconi ICE is a strategic business simulation game in which you will start and manage a small handmade ice cream business and sell ice cream around the world; Milan, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Moscow, Mumbai, Munich, New York, Paris, Rio De Janeiro, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo. The ice cream entrepreneur\\u2019s day starts with a glance at the news (weather forecasts influencing the flow of people to the potential locations) and continues with important strategic decisions. The player chooses the location of the stand, the tools to buy, the employees to hire (you could need a cashier to quicken the queue or a juggler to entertain the clients), whether to spend money on promotion, the recipe of the ice cream (watery and cheap or rich and expensive?), how much stock, often perishable, to buy.  The player strives to control his or her heartbeat while looking at the people walking around his stand, buying or not buying his or her ice cream as a function of the strategic decisions taken before and may decide to modify them in real time changing the settings in the Marketing Mixer. At the end of each working day, the game presents economic and financial reports showing the results of the day. The following day, the player can change his or her strategies according to the experience gained. The players can compete with each other, sending their results to Facebook score, which compares them, allowing them to understand how good they are in selling ice cream.

Other popular dimensions are 13\\xd713 and 19\\xd719 as a result of the game\\s relationship to the older game of Go. According to the book A Beautiful Mind, John Nash (one of the game\\s inventors) advocated 14\\xd714 as the optimal size.  History  The game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein, who introduced it in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was independently re-invented in 1947 by the mathematician John Nash at Princeton University. Hex is an abstract strategy game that belongs to the general category of connection games.   Rules  Each player has an allocated color, Red and Blue being conventional. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal is to form a connected path of your stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by your color, before your opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.  The turn of each player is shown by a red or blue disc on a side of the board game. The player must touch a cell to fill it with his own color. After that, he can cancel his last move using the \\Undo\\ button, and redo a different move. When the move is done, the turn comes of the opponent player.  John Nash proved in 1952 that a game of Hex cannot end in a tie, and that for a symmetric board there exists a winning strategy for the player who makes the first move (by the strategy-stealing argument). However, the argument is non-constructive: it only shows the existence of a winning strategy, without describing it explicitly. Finding an explicit strategy has been the main subject of research since then.', Developer: 'Luigi Fonti', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 612352, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pirate-legends-td/id626884809', Name: 'Pirate Legends TD', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple30/v4/25/f3/55/25f35576-2eed-c04b-a150-e463ab3bf6fc/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'If you looking for a respectable tower defense game that is challenging and looks great, then Pirate Legends TD is the game for you Pocket Gamer  Navigate your pirate ship through the deadly waters of the Caribbean as you defend yourself from the evil Imperial Navy, hungry Cannibals, and the restless Undead Horde.

It is uncertain whether this specific game dates back to the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, or whether instead it developed in the post-colonial era after the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores.  It is impossible to know when exactly the game was developed or what the original rules were as very few records survived the invasion by the conquistadors (between the 15th and 17th centuries).   Rules for two players  The overall objective is to capture and subsequently kill the playing pieces of the opposition, so the game is in essence a war game.  The playing area is divided up into equal spaces using rods, placed parallel to each other. The two players have control of a base at either end of the play area.  The players take five stones or figurines, yellow for the first player and red for the second one, initially placed in their respective bases.  The movement of the stones is determined by the roll of four dice or bul (corn kernels). These are painted black on one half so that they land showing either a yellow or black face. The number of faces showing determines how many spaces a stone can move:  1 yellow - 1 space 2 yellow - 2 spaces 3 yellow - 3 spaces 4 yellow - 4 spaces 0 yellow (all black) - 5 spaces  Taking it in turns, players roll the bul, pushing a colored button and move any of their stones the corresponding number of spaces toward the enemy base.   A stone cannot move to a space where there is already a friendly stone. If there is no other option but to do this, a player must pass, pressing the Pass button.  When a stone lands on the same space as an enemy stone, the enemy stone is captured and is no longer controlled by the enemy player. The enemy stone is placed beneath the capturing stone to reflect its captured state.   Every time the capturing stone moves, its prisoners are moved with it. If a stone lands on an enemy stone which already has prisoners, it captures that stone and its prisoners, and these are placed beneath it.  When a stone captures an enemy stone, it immediately reverses direction and begins heading back to the home base.  Once a stone and its prisoners reach home, any enemy stones are removed from the game, or killed. Friendly stones are liberated or returned back to the set of stones which can be played.  Once a player has killed every enemy stone, he wins.', Developer: 'Luigi Fonti', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 2537472, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-wide-resort-hd/id639579958', Name: 'World Wide Resort HD', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/95/84/15/958415a1-5dda-98a3-3392-08b5087e04ec/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Is \\u2018Divide and rule\\u2019 your personal motto?

Black and white pieces, twenty-two each, are arranged on all points but the center.  The objective of the game is to capture all the opponents pieces.   The game is a draw if neither player succeeds in this.  Capturing is done by either approaching or withdrawing from opponents pieces.  The board consists of lines and intersections, creating a grid with 5 rows and 9 columns,  subdivided diagonally to form part of the tetrakis square tiling of the plane.  A line represents the path along which a stone can move during the game.   There are weak and strong intersections.  At a weak intersection it is only possible to move a stone horizontally and vertically,  while on a strong intersection it is also possible to move a stone diagonally.  A stone can only move from one intersection to an adjacent intersection.  Players alternate turns, starting with White. A white/black ball near the screen bottom signals the current player...  We distinguish two kinds of moves, non-capturing and capturing moves.  A non-capturing move is called a paika move. A paika move consists of moving one stone along a line to an adjacent intersection.  Capturing implies removing one or more pieces of the opponent.  It can be done in two ways, either (1) by approach or (2) by withdrawal.  An approach is moving the capturing stone to a point adjacent to an opponent stone  provided that the stone is on the continuation of the capturing stones movement line.  A withdrawal works analogously to an approach except that the movement is away from the opponent stone.  When an opponent stone is captured, all opponent pieces in line behind that stone  (as long as there is no interruption by an empty point or an own stone) are captured as well. If a player can do an approach and a withdrawal at the same time, he has to choose which one he plays.  The game ends when one player captures all stones of the opponent.  If neither player can achieve this, the game is a draw.', Developer: 'Luigi Fonti', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 6463488, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1863/id642388693', Name: 1863, Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/73/b6/e1/73b6e183-9bf7-2e37-3390-bcfe3fab1eba/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Special Battle of Gettysburg Edition of Cannon Shooter  To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg we have created a special addition of Cannon Shooter.

High resolution, letter lotto balls make up your board, bouncing, rolling, and falling into place with realistic 3D physics. Every new game refreshes the board, watch them tumble into place, then the challenge begins. Tap touching balls in sequence to make words, the longer the better. Traditional letter scores, length multipliers, gold ball doublers, and a bingo bonus determine the words value. Tap the final letter again, and pop-pop-pop, the balls burst and disappear causing the remaining balls to tumble into the empty spots and alter the layout. Choose your words carefully to maximize your results. Want to add more challenge, play a Shootout and pit your skills against friends or other Game Center players. The easiest difficulty allows two letter words, the hardest requires at least four letter words, the remaining levels a more traditional three letter minimum. You choose how hard to make it. So, why wait? Start word hunting!  Scoring: Multiplier for number of letters. Scores for each letter:    1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U    2 points: D, G    3 points: B, C, M, P    4 points: F, H, V, W, Y    5 points: K    8 points: J, X    10 points: Q, Z Gold balls double the total. Example: MEOW, (M 3, E 1, O 1, W 4) * (Letters 4) = 36  Instructions: Tap touching letter balls to make up words. Tap the last letter ball a second time to complete the word and claim your points. Each letter multiplies your total score, gold balls double your score, and 7 letter or more words score a 50 point bingo bonus. Multiple gold balls keep doubling your score. Traditional letter scoring is in effect, harder to use letters give higher scores. Want to try another word? Just tap on a distant ball to begin again. Blank balls act as blocks and may not be used. Choose your words carefully, once the balls burst, the boards changes, sometimes dramatically. Strategy, combined with word hunting skills are key to maximum scores. Every board may be replayed as often as you like, just choose Retry.  Enough reading, its time to start tapping ... 99 Letters!   Highlights:  Exclusive to iOS. Realistic 3D physics.

All plays are movie names, and movies are connected by actors. You play a movie connected to mine, then I play one connected to yours. Opponents fire movies back and forth getting points for each play. It may take seven or more connected movies to reach 100 points and win the game.  Fireback Movies is simple to understand but challenging and entertaining. Traditional trivia games ask random lists of trivia questions. In Fireback Movies, each player dynamically creates the challenge posed to the opponent on each turn. For example, if your opponent plays Boogie Nights, you could fire back Almost Famous (connected by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) There are limitless possibilities of finding one degree connections between movies using any actor.  Fireback Movies is a casual game where players can take their turns when they want. Fireback Movies checks your connections by referencing its proprietary database of 250,000 movies. It knows when there is more than one connection even when you do not. When players take their turns, the app gives immediate feedback to support the option for rapid-fire play. The actors who connect movies are shown after each play.  Unlike most trivia games, Fireback Movies lets you show your personality. In Fireback Movies, players play movies they are familiar with. As opponents reveal their movie knowledge, you learn about them. A game against one friend is a different experience from one against another.  Plays in Fireback Movies are strategic. Some connected movies score more points than others. If you can play a movie with different actor connections from the last play, it is called a Change Connection and gets the most bonus points. Bonus points are also awarded for multiple actor connections and fast play.  When players are stumped in Fireback Movies, they can use lifelines or pass. Lifelines are popular movies connected by popular actors that keep the game fun for both players. Fireback Movies is a freemium full-featured game with no limitations requiring purchases or advantages for people to pay to win.  One Degree Games created Fireback Movies to give movie fans a new way to connect with each other by connecting movies!

Captain Memo and the Addimals have come to save the day, but they can\\u2019t do it alone. Help the Addimals win back the golden blocks and restore El Sumado to its former glory!    Developed by former teachers and experts in children\\u2019s cognition and learning, Addimal Adventure is an engaging game that teaches addition. The Addimal characters model effective strategies for solving math facts. Children practice using these strategies during the tool round, while the speed round encourages memorization, providing hints as needed.   Most addition apps focus on drill with digital worksheets and flashcards. In contrast, our app teaches effective math strategies and scaffolds learning to promote conceptual understanding and fact fluency.  Addimal Adventure is a great tool for teaching different ways to solve problems and for parents to support their children\\u2019s learning at home.   Recommended Grades: K-2, 3-5 (intervention)  Meets Many Common Core, TEKS, and other State Math Standards.

The goal is to catch as many fish as you can. But the lake you are fishing from is not the best place to go fishing. Theres a lot of junk that has piled up in the lake, and more often than not thats what youll pull out when you cast your line. But every now and then youll get a fish or two.  This game is similar to Danger 13 from Ravensburger Spielverlag GmbH, which was created by R\\xfcdiger Dorn.  The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by catching fish. You do this by keeping good cards and giving bad cards to your opponents. Its not that easy, though, because once you give a player a card you cant take it back or given them a different card later in the current hand. And, to make it harder, the score of each player isnt known until the end of the game, so you have to pay attention to which player is scoring points as the game goes on.  Play with your friends locally, or against the computer.  Multiplayer support via Game Center is coming in a future update, so you can hone your skills now against your iPhone or iPod Touch or via pass-and-play with your friends.  * This game is not in any way endorsed by or affiliated with Ravensburger Speilverlag GmbH.

Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponents pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changes situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play or when he has no more GIPF-pieces on the board.  Aim The first player to create a situation where his opponent either has no more pieces in his reserve or no more GIPF-pieces on the board, wins the game. So, keep in mind: make sure to always have at least one piece in reserve and always at least one GIPF-piece on the board.   Pieces The players start with 18 pieces in reserve each. Pieces in reserve are pieces of your own color that are not in play. A GIPF-piece is 2 pieces stacked one upon another.   The board  There are 24 dots at the edges of the pattern on the board. Dots are not part of the play area; they serve to position a piece before bringing it into play. The play area is made up of 37 spots (intersections). Only the pieces covering a spot are part of the game. The lines indicate in which directions pieces may be moved.   First move: GIPF-piece  Yellow begins. A yellow disk on your side tells you its your turn. Your first move must be a GIPF-piece. Touch and drag a piece out of your reserve and put it on any of the black dots. At your first move, two pieces are sum stacked and moved together. Next push the double (GIPF) piece onto an adjacent spot. You may move a piece only one spot at a time, never two or more.   Then the turn of your opponent comes. A red disk on his side indicates it is the red turn. The red player should touch and drag a double (GIPF) piece to an empty black dot. Next push that piece onto an adjacent spot.  Moving other pieces Both players have made one move. When introducing a piece you can either move it to an empty spot, or to an already occupied spot. If the spot is already occupied, that piece is automatically pushed to the next spot on the line (if that spot would also be occupied, then this piece also moves over one spot, etc.)  Introducing single pieces  Both players may introduce as many GIPF-pieces as they want, until they bring a single piece into play. After the first move, every time a player drags a piece into the game, he may choose if a double (GIPF) or a single piece should be moved. After you have inserted a single piece, you have no more choice: all the following moves will insert single pieces. When learning the game, we advise you to play with 3 or 4 GIPF-pieces.   Two restrictions:  1. A piece already in play may not be moved as a separate piece. A piece (or more pieces) on the board can only be moved by introducing a new piece. All of the pieces in play may be pushed by both players, black and white pieces, single and GIPF-pieces. 2. When all the spots on a line are occupied, you cannot play in the direction of that line. If you would, you would push a piece out of the game at the opposite site and that is not allowed.   Recycling and capturing pieces As soon as 4 single pieces of your color are lined up on adjacent spots (dots dont count!), they are taken from the board. Moreover, not only must these 4 pieces be removed, but also the pieces that form a direct extension of them. The pieces of your own color are returned to your reserve, the pieces of the other color are captured, thus lost to your opponent. Opponents GIPF pieces are automatically removed; your GIPF pieces can be removed or left, at your choice.  End of a game There are two ways of winning: you must capture your opponents last GIPF-piece or you must exhaust his reserve. As said in the beginning: a player who has either no more GIPF-pieces on the board, or has no more pieces left to make a move, loses the game.', Developer: 'Luigi Fonti', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 727040, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spider-solitaire/id662083994', Name: 'Spider-Solitaire', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/81/23/96/8123964e-a098-3067-3161-4c692fa03b92/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Familiar with Windows spider solitaire game for you?

In Mahjongg, youre presented with stack of tiles, forming towers or pyramids, or other abstract structures. Your task is to find and match identical tiles and clear the board. Its not as simple as it sounds, because some tiles are blocked you must try to move tiles that will unblock more tiles.   The challenge in Mahjong is to not end up with an unsovable board, so carefully plan your moves before picking tiles to match. Some moves will free more tiles and that is usually (but not always) a good move. Some moves may cause the board to be unsovable (because all tiles are blocked), but in this situation we provide a couple of Shuffle option to reset the board to a solvable state (the exception is when only 2 tiles are remaining and theyre on top of each other).  Over 50 board layout (levels) configurations, all free to play, including the classic/traditional turtle/pyramid board layout/tower. Some of the stacks has epic number of tiles (300+) which should provide plenty of challenge for Mahjong fans. Tile positions on the game boards are placed randomly on every board level - with a special algorithm that makes them always solvable if you make the correct moves.

It features 20 different bullpen sessions. Each bullpen sequence consists of 20 pitches.  All are named according to the goals of the sequence and ranked by difficulty from easiest to hardest. Each session teaches and documents pitch command, selection, and sequencing.    Each bullpen features different methods and strategies of how to get hitters out.  They were all practiced and executed in games to advance Steve Stemle, the inventor of the Lokator Target and System, to the Major Leagues.  They were also crucial tools he used when teaching young pitchers the chess match between the hitter and pitcher while coaching and working at various academies.   In the Bullpen App Blog at www.lokatorpitchingacademy.com he gives descriptions of exactly what pitchers are trying to accomplish during each bullpen and the reasoning behind the method so parents and coaches can relay information to each pitcher while throwing the bullpen.   Once a pitcher creates a profile and selects a bullpen to throw its time to play ball.  The target screen will display the pitch number in the sequence, what Lokations to aim at, and which pitch to throw.  Below this information a Lokator Target will have targeted zones highlighted making visualization and communication easy for the scorekeeper.   When the pitch is thrown at the designated Lokation\\xa0a teammate, coach, parent, (scorekeeper) will touch the target on the screen where the ball actually hit.\\xa0\\xa0The App will show a check if the Lokation is hit or an X if it is not.  This is where the retries function comes into play.  Pitchers have the option to choose between 1 and 4 retries for missed targets on the bullpen selection screen.  If pitchers choose the 0 retry option, then bullpens will always be 20 pitches.  If they were to choose 4 retries, then its possible that the bullpen could be 80 pitches long if no Lokations were hit.  This feature enables pitchers to make adjustments from pitch to pitch, throw longer bullpens, and get rewarded for hitting Lokations early and often when competing for a high ranking by Lokator Score.     In addition to the retry feature on the bullpen selection screen there is also a distance option to select how far each pitcher is from the target.  This comes in handy for pitchers who throw at different distances or if pitchers are not throwing from full distance so everybody is on the same playing field.    When the bullpen has been completed, statistics in four categories are automatically stored in the App database. Two of the categories use the Lokator Score to judge effectiveness and rank each pitcher according to targets hit and the number of pitches it took to hit each target.  The remaining two reports are Accuracy Reports.  The first one gives a percentage of total targets hit for each individual bullpen and the other gives percentages of hits for each individual target of the Lokator design.        After the Bullpen is over and the reports have been generated, check to see how well you did with Lokator Scores and Accuracy Reports. Look at how you are matching up against other pitchers on the team or friends in the neighborhood with report rankings. \\xa0Then use the email function to report statistics to anyone right from the Report Screen.\\xa0  The Lokator Bullpen will guide pitchers through all Lokations with every pitch in a way that doesnt favor just the pitchers strengths.  When pitchers enter the Lokator Bullpen they get the most well rounded bullpen session possible and we know from experience that this is the best way to improve.', Developer: 'THE LOKATOR PITCHING ACADEMY LLC', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 73735168, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stand-ofood-city-virtual-frenzy/id672707752', Name: 'Stand O\\u2019Food\\xae City: Virtual Frenzy', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/cc/b6/1b/ccb61bef-f998-7122-0299-5d0d4b183fb5/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Ready to build a burger dynasty?

PLAY NUMBERS NO ONE ELSE IS PLAYING\\u203c Smarter Quick Pick is designed to find you those numbers. It eliminates common patterns people use\\u2014such as dates\\u2014giving you confidence you won\\t be sharing your prize!  Imagine - you wait your whole life for that big lottery jackpot. You finally win, and guess what? You have to share your prize with other winners! Can\\t be avoided, right? Actually, yes it can!  The first thing to understand when playing the lottery is that every ticket has the same chance of winning. Yes, even 1-2-3-4-5*6! I know this sounds crazy, but there was actually a lottery drawing in Germany that came up 2-3-4-5-6*26. And guess what happened? Over 38,000 people had to split that jackpot!  That\\s when it hit me: People have systems for picking lottery numbers, and if I can avoid those patterns, I can drastically increase my odds of not having to share the winnings!  Have you ever wondered why so many lottery jackpots have multiple winners, while so many other drawings have no winners at all? You\\ve probably seen it many times: big jackpot, millions of players, and no one wins. Drawing after drawing, no winners. And the jackpot grows and grows. Then finally one drawing has 2...3...sometimes even 5 winners - all at once! Why is that??  The secret is in the drawings that had no winners. If you look at those numbers, you will see something amazing - no patterns! No dates, no anniversaries - nothing in particular that would have made someone want to use those numbers. These are the types of numbers you want to play!!  We have analyzed these patterns and designed Smarter Quick Pick specifically to avoid them. Smarter Quick Pick will give you numbers to play that have a low liklihood of being played by others. After all, why would you play numbers that other people are playing??  You may be wondering why you need this app when lotteries already have Quick Pick... Well, you should never use a lottery\\s built-in Quick Pick\\u203c Here are two very good reasons why:  \\u25b6 Reason #1: You may actually be increasing your odds of having to share! Computers cannot generate random numbers on their own - they need a starting point (or \\u201cseed\\u201d) number \\u2013 and most of them use the time of day. Quick Picks are generated on the spot by the local lottery terminal. These terminals operate independently, using the current date & time to help them decide what your random numbers will be. With potentially hundreds of other people buying tickets at that moment across the region, the chances of getting the same numbers as someone else go up.  \\u25b6 Reason #2: Quick Picks do not eliminate numbers and patterns people use often.

You can select mobile phone tracking, for example, and point the smartphone or tablet\\u2019s camera at the four radio masts on the game board. Green, yellow or red radio waves will indicate whether or not Mr X is nearby. You can also question witnesses at important buildings across the city. The camera comes into play again, showing Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral in 3D. Witnesses will reveal whether Mr X is or has recently been there.   Furthermore, the detectives can determine his possible locations by analysing his previous moves, or by measuring the distance between Mr X and the nearest radio mast. But if you think you\\u2019ve already got Mr X in the bag, you can think again. With his new escape option, the helicopter, he\\u2019s as cunning as ever.

Sick and tired of his father\\u2019s slurs and insults, Louis decides to leaves behind a life of wealth and comfort, he wants to know the real world, what it is out there but before he can do that he enters the Dark Forest where he meets a young woman, but things are not what it seems, choose Louis Versetti\\u2019s path wisely.  One of the finest vehicles of the large Versetti fleet approaches the stately gates of the family residence, a huge luxurious mansion constructed with the finest materials to be found in the whole of Scotland. The car drives through lovely gardens for over seventy meters, but when it stops at the mansion\\u2019s front entrance, nobody steps out of the vehicle, as the butler patiently waits at the ready to welcome the vehicle\\u2019s occupants.   The sound of someone shouting can be heard when the car door opens after a few minutes.  That\\u2019s the last time I\\u2019m putting up with your slurs and your insults, yelled Louis Versetti, son of the multimillionaire Paolo Versetti.  Very slowly and calmly, Louis\\u2019 father steps out of the car after his son; he doesn\\u2019t follow him, he just looks at him with a hard and dismissive stare.   You think I don\\u2019t deserve any of this.  Do you think I\\u2019m not worthy?  Okay, so that\\u2019s the way it will be then; I will not accept a penny of your fortune; I will not accept anything that is yours.  I\\m leaving this house right now!  Louis exclaimed energetically in a determined tone of voice, while his father just looked on with a smirk on his face, which, if anything, just provoked him all the more, making him even angrier.   Louis turns around slowly, and without hesitation begins to walk through the large garden, back towards the mansion\\u2019s gate. No one makes a single sound; the only thing to be heard is the sound the shoes make as they walk down the paved driveway; those fine shoes which were manufactured in Italy, his father\\u2019s native land. His father came to this country when he was very young and single-handedly became a millionaire in just ten years by creating multiple companies.  Louis is about to reach the gate, and all he\\u2019s taking with him to face the world on his own is just a leather jacket and some money in his wallet.  I\\u2019ll show him what I can accomplish on my own, thinks the 23-year-old, who feels he is ready to forge his own path in life.    Before leaving the grounds, he turns a little to the right to look at the small storage shed where old things are kept, and where he knows his old motorcycle is stored. It\\u2019s been years since he last used it, so it must be very dusty and maybe even a little rusty, but Louis is almost certain that it still works.   Although Louis had been determined to leave on foot, he thinks it will be much better on that bike. He is about to go and pick up the motorcycle when he remembers it was a gift given to him by his father when he was 15 and stops in his tracks to think for a moment:  Choose his path wisely, what would you do?

My Planet runs in real time, even when the the game is closed.  Therefore, you must keep checking back throughout the day to make sure your planet is running at optimal levels.  The controls are simple to use, by mastery can take weeks.  Can you achieve the ultimate goal of growing your planet to over 1,000,000 people?  Or will your planet burn under the sun while your people anguish?  The choice is yours!  The ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline.   Vegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water. If you have too much, vegetation will flood out and die. To little, and drought will set in. Check your planet every day to make sure you have the optimal amount of sun and water!  I am always looking to improve my apps, so if you have any ideas on how to make My Planet better, please let me know.

REVIEWS Snakehead Games has pioneered Social Browser Based Games for 7 years; some players have been with us from the start, some are newer. Zombie Moon takes that awesome experience and brings it to mobile.  Some of their reviews are:  -Addictive kind of like Dungeons and Dragons in space.  -Awesome!! I have played SHG games for years. Best one yet ... awesome job guys!!   -Wicked Space Game If you like SyFy then you should enjoy this game.  -Addictive and full of hidden depths This is a simple game. Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\\s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.  -Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies.   Review from one of the Game Creators As one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\\s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\\s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works.   I love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.  There is a mystery involved, and that unrolls through the Missions.    The game is free; you really don\\t have to pay to play, nor give Snakehead private info, to continue.  I love being part of an awesome Snakehead Games community that loves our games.

Zhou Yu, the chief military commander of the Wu Kingdom, ordered Zhu Ge Liang (the chief minister of the Shu Kingdom and generally regarded as the kingdom\\s top master-mind) to produce 100,000 arrows within 10 days.  Three days is enough,  said Zhu. He also aGREed to be punished if he failed to complete the order.   Zhou mocked that Zhu was looking for self-destruction. On the one hand, Zhou ordered his troops not to provide Zhu with materials to make the arrows. He also sent Lu Su to see how Zhu was dealing the problem.   In fact, Zhu had already realized that this was a plot. He asked Lu (who was kind-hearted) to lend him 20 boats, each lined with straw scarecrows and manned by 30 soldiers. He also requested that Lu not tell Zhou what was happening.   When Lu came again to see Zhu, he did not find anything unusual. Nothing happened on the second day either. In the early morning of the third day, Zhu invited Lu for a boat ride. The 20 boats were tied together with strong ropes. Zhu\\s fleet sailed toward the camp of Cao Cao (who was the king of the Wei Kingdom).   A thick mist had spread over the surface of the river. People could hardly see each other on the river. When Zhu\\s fleet got close to the Cao camp before dawn, Zhu ordered his soldiers to shout and beat drums to fake an attack. Zhu and Lu simply sat inside one of the boats and drank wine to enjoy themselves.   As soon as the Cao camp heard the shouting and drum beating, they mistook it for a surprise attack by the Zhou camp. Since they could see nobody on the river, they gathered 3,000 bowmen and ordered them to shoot arrows. The front of the scarecrows was quickly shot full of arrows.   After a while, Zhu had his fleet turn around to expose the other side of the scarecrows. When this side was also shot full of arrows, the day broke. Zhu ordered his soldiers to return to their base port. The soldiers shouted, Thank you, Cao, for your arrows. After they got back to their camp, they collected more than 100,000 arrows from the scarecrows.', Developer: 'JUN ZHU', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 22847488, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/battle-fortress-war/id719394052', Name: 'Battle Fortress War', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/11/9e/c8/119ec8c7-f5ae-900f-9605-8414b046c793/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Battle for WORLD DOMINATION over progressive Age\\u2019s, beginning in the Stone Age, and advancing all the way through to the Space Age (if you survive!).

Well played games are awarded more points to split between players. Close games split the point nearly evenly.

Become a public transport tycoon and enjoy this nontraditional strategy and time management game. Play through the history from 1960 up to 2020, buy many of different buses, upgrade the stations and find the best strategy to achieve all trophies in time.   Citizens expect comfort buses and this is important - do not let them order a taxi! Each bus offers specific number of capacity, price and XP points for each transported passenger. City is changing each level so you will need your brain. Be a smart director and organize your pocket bus imperium wisely.  Tired of tons of confusing tables during growing your virtual business yet? This simulation game is really easy to control, tutorial is short, clever and multilanguage so you will enjoy the challenge in the first early moments.   Get this sweet and addictive game and transport them all!  STRATEGY TIPS: - UNDERSTANDING THE CITY From the very first moment of the level you should watch the buildings! The taller building you are looking at, the bigger potential it has! Taller buildings offer more passengers. So your first line should be going through these huge buildings!  - PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING Citizens want to be transported! Anyhow. If there is no line created by your company, they will choose a taxi. And this is the point! Each passenger gives you the XP you need for the trophies and winning each level! Taxi on the board means you have lost 20 passengers! A lot of XP! Like the previous paragraph said: a bigger building equals more passengers.  - XP UNDERSTANDING Each bus gives you a specific number of XP for each transported passenger. Think about it, deeply. When you buy a bus with 7 XP and you loose 20 passengers (1 person on the board), it means 140 XP. Try not to lose too much XP.  - CHOOSING CORRECT STARTING LINE As stated you should explore the city at the beginning. Start your first line on the place where there are a lot of bigger buildings! Bigger buildings mean a lot of potencial lost passengers (stolen by the taxi). This is really important to think about!  - CHOOSING CORRECT VEHICLE Are you purchasing the buses without thinking about their price and capacity? This is crucial. XP is not everything in the very first moments! You have probably bought the best possible bus at the beginning (because you want as much XP as possible) but your station capacity is only 20 passengers (without upgrades). This is the issue! A bus with huge capacity is useless when you don\\xb4t upgrade the stations (it serves 20 more people per each upgrade). So where is the point? You will be doing well with bus with small capacity and price at the beginning. Small XP earnings are not important in the beginning! First of all you need money for better buses in the near future! You can earn a lot of money with cheaper buses in the beginning! That\\xb4s why cash is important! Buy better buses after some time. Expensive buses with huge capacity make sense only if you can serve a bigger number of passengers at the stations! Always think about the ratio between the capacity of a station and the capacity of a bus! A wrong strategy can consupt your money and then your XP by the taxis!  - UPGRADING THE STATIONS This paragraph is linked to previous. Imagine you have bought a bus with a small capacity. So there is no sense to upgrade the stations to their maximum while you are saving money for better buses! Station upgrades are expensive! Upgrade the stations after buying a new bus. Immediately, if possible.  - SELLING OLD TRAMS The best strategy is to sell your buses after they have reached their final station. Let the buses serve all passengers on their line. Then sell them before reaching their depot when an accident occurs.', Developer: 'Daniel Viktorin', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 22462464, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindmap-mind-mapping-for-draft-diagram/id725222275', Name: 'MindMap - Mind Mapping for Draft & Diagram', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/04/dc/30/04dc3051-6538-17f8-1f52-4eaf45a7d087/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Mindmap  lets you easily enter ideas, tasks, and meeting notes into intuitive visual maps that help you quickly organize concepts and prioritize action items.

Can you pretend to be a kind of person you are not? Can you tell who is pretending and who is real?  Choose a characteristic that two out of the three of you share and the remaining one will pretend to share. Choose male, female, religious, sports fan, football player, or whatever you like. One of the two who possesses the characteristic plays judge, the other plays non-pretender and the third person plays pretender. If you are the judge you get to ask as many questions as you like of the other two; you can make your guess at any stage.  If you pick \\u2018quick game\\u2019 you play once. If you pick \\u2018full game\\u2019 there are three rounds and everyone plays each role in turn, so you will have to change the characteristic between rounds.   Two players share a trait (e.g. both are male, or both sports fans) while the third player does not (e.g. she is a woman, or doesn\\u2019t follow any team). One of the two players that share the trait becomes the judge and must question the others to identify the pretender.  Sound easy? Youd be surprised.  Play this game to see how good you are at spotting who is passing themselves off as someone else or to see if you know enough about the other two player\\u2019s lives to pretend to be someone you\\u2019re not.  Based on a Victorian parlour game adapted by Alan Turing for his Turing Test for artificial intelligence and developed from cutting edge social science research at Cardiff University.  Masquerade has three modes of play: - a tutorial with a few sample questions and answers - a single round game where a judge asks questions to try to identify the pretender - a three player, three-round game where you compete against your friends to identify the pretender and play a pretend role yourself  Masquerade can be played by either three players sharing one device or between three separate devices over the Internet.

Variants included ---------------  KLONDIKE - This is the \\u201cclassic\\u201d solitaire or patience game. If you\\u2019ve played \\u201csolitaire\\u201d or \\u201cpatience\\u201d without knowing precisely which game you were playing, it was probably Klondike. Cards are built on to the tableau in downwards sequence, alternating color (red/black). Empty columns are filled with a King or sequence beginning with a King.  WHITEHEAD - This is an easier variant of Klondike. All cards are visible from the start of the game. Build on to the tableau in downwards sequence, with cards of the same color. Move sequences that are of the same suit. Any card or sequence can fill an empty column.  AGNES - In this variant, foundations do not necessarily start with an Ace.

A competitive strategy game set on the most smallest of floating islands, remains from a place where peace and prosperity were fact - until two greedy sons lost their senses after their father passed away.  This is the beginning of an epic battle for the remaining lands. Who will get the most land? Who gets the most Victory Points? Who is the most strategic one? Is it you?  Game Features:  - One Player - Freeplay or Missions  - Online Multiplayer  - Awesome graphics - pixel art!  - Smooth and intuitive gameplay  - Competitive leaderboards  Your farmers must battle the opponents for resources, while at the same time acquiring food to live!  You both start off with two farmers; the first thing you\\u2019ll need to do is acquire food for your farmers - each farmer consumes one bit of food per round! If you run out of food, the farmers will start to eat grain - and if they can\\u2019t eat grain they\\u2019ll take a bite from your Victory Points - which you DO NOT WANT THEM TO EAT!  But, you can\\u2019t go around collecting food all day, that gets you nowhere and certainly wont get you any Victory Points! So you have to go set about gathering the other resources too! Each farmer can perform one action on each round - get more farmers to make more moves! Get some stone, wood, wheat, food and lots of animals to gain the edge on your opponent!  Then its time to build! Each game starts with random building cards to give you (or the opponent) the upper hand. Some buildings are purely for Victory Points, while others are more practical - giving you food or other resources.  Youre not just playing for fun either, you can compete in missions to test your winning strategy. Other games are easy, this is the exception!

GOAL: Uncover cards so they can be moved in ascending order to the 4 suit stacks.  SETUP: A standard deck is dealt in 8 cascading stacks.  HOW TO PLAY: Move cards between the 8 cascading stacks and 4 free cells to uncover cards so you can move them up to complete the suit stacks. You can only move the top card of a cascading stack or a card in a free cell. A card can be moved to an empty free cell; to the top of another cascading stack with top card of different color and one higher value; or to one of 4 suit stacks in ascending order from Ace to King. For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a cascading stack with top card 4 of hearts. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell or empty cascading stack.  MOVING CARDS: Tapping a card once will move it to a suit stack if a spot is available or to a pile with available higher card of different color. Double-tapping a card will move it to an open free cell. Alternatively, you can simply drag a card to where you want it to go. If an attempted move is not allowed, the card will shake.
