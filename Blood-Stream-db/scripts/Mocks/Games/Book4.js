It is similar to card game Spades played in Western world. The objective of the game is to score the highest points of all as well as to stop other players from getting higher points by breaking their call (Hence the name Call Break). The points are accumulated in the form of hands. Hand is same as trick in Spades. After the cards are dealt, players make call (bid) in the range of 1-13 hands that they expect to capture based on their cards. Players with several high cards and high number of spades would make a higher call than a player with mostly low cards and less spades cards. The cards are ranked form highest to lowest in the usual way (Ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest). Spades, as said earlier is higher ranked suit. Players try to play trick on other players to make them loose their higher cards. After playing five rounds, a player is declared winner with the highest points.\\nIn this version, you will play with three intelligent robot players devised to simulate real-time players. Their playing strategy can be preset from game settings. The app also keeps records of player\\s score and other important statistics.

Other popular dimensions are 13\\xd713 and 19\\xd719 as a result of the game\\s relationship to the older game of Go. According to the book A Beautiful Mind, John Nash (one of the game\\s inventors) advocated 14\\xd714 as the optimal size.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe game was invented by the Danish mathematician Piet Hein, who introduced it in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was independently re-invented in 1947 by the mathematician John Nash at Princeton University. Hex is an abstract strategy game that belongs to the general category of connection games. \\n\\nRules\\n\\nEach player has an allocated color, Red and Blue being conventional. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal is to form a connected path of your stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by your color, before your opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.\\n\\nThe turn of each player is shown by a red or blue disc on a side of the board game.\\nThe player must touch a cell to fill it with his own color. After that, he can cancel his last move using the \\Undo\\ button, and redo a different move. When the move is done, the turn comes of the opponent player.\\n\\nJohn Nash proved in 1952 that a game of Hex cannot end in a tie, and that for a symmetric board there exists a winning strategy for the player who makes the first move (by the strategy-stealing argument). However, the argument is non-constructive: it only shows the existence of a winning strategy, without describing it explicitly. Finding an explicit strategy has been the main subject of research since then.","Developer":"Luigi Fonti","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":612352,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pirate-legends-td/id626884809","Name":"Pirate Legends TD","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple30/v4/25/f3/55/25f35576-2eed-c04b-a150-e463ab3bf6fc/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"If you\e looking for a respectable tower defense game that is challenging and looks great, then Pirate Legends TD is the game for you Pocket Gamer\\n\\nNavigate your pirate ship through the deadly waters of the Caribbean as you defend yourself from the evil Imperial Navy, hungry Cannibals, and the restless Undead Horde.

The two players have control of a base at either end of the play area.\\n\\nThe players take five stones or figurines, yellow for the first player and red for the second one, initially placed in their respective bases.\\n\\nThe movement of the stones is determined by the roll of four dice or bul (corn kernels). These are painted black on one half so that they land showing either a yellow or black face. The number of faces showing determines how many spaces a stone can move:\\n\\n1 yellow - 1 space\\n2 yellow - 2 spaces\\n3 yellow - 3 spaces\\n4 yellow - 4 spaces\\n0 yellow (all black) - 5 spaces\\n\\nTaking it in turns, players roll the bul, pushing a colored button and move any of their stones the corresponding number of spaces toward the enemy base. \\n\\nA stone cannot move to a space where there is already a friendly stone. If there is no other option but to do this, a player must pass, pressing the Pass button.\\n\\nWhen a stone lands on the same space as an enemy stone, the enemy stone is captured and is no longer controlled by the enemy player. The enemy stone is placed beneath the capturing stone to reflect its captured state. \\n\\nEvery time the capturing stone moves, its prisoners are moved with it. If a stone lands on an enemy stone which already has prisoners, it captures that stone and its prisoners, and these are placed beneath it.\\n\\nWhen a stone captures an enemy stone, it immediately reverses direction and begins heading back to the home base.\\n\\nOnce a stone and its prisoners reach home, any enemy stones are removed from the game, or killed. Friendly stones are liberated or returned back to the set of stones which can be played.\\n\\nOnce a player has killed every enemy stone, he wins.","Developer":"Luigi Fonti","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":2537472,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-wide-resort-hd/id639579958","Name":"World Wide Resort HD","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/95/84/15/958415a1-5dda-98a3-3392-08b5087e04ec/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Is \\u2018Divide and rule\\u2019 your personal motto?

Traditional letter scores, length multipliers, gold ball doublers, and a bingo bonus determine the words value. Tap the final letter again, and pop-pop-pop, the balls burst and disappear causing the remaining balls to tumble into the empty spots and alter the layout. Choose your words carefully to maximize your results. Want to add more challenge, play a Shootout and pit your skills against friends or other Game Center players. The easiest difficulty allows two letter words, the hardest requires at least four letter words, the remaining levels a more traditional three letter minimum. You choose how hard to make it.

All plays are movie names, and movies are connected by actors. You play a movie connected to mine, then I play one connected to yours. Opponents fire movies back and forth getting points for each play. It may take seven or more connected movies to reach 100 points and win the game.\\n\\nFireback Movies is simple to understand but challenging and entertaining. Traditional trivia games ask random lists of trivia questions. In Fireback Movies, each player dynamically creates the challenge posed to the opponent on each turn. For example, if your opponent plays Boogie Nights, you could fire back Almost Famous (connected by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) There are limitless possibilities of finding one degree connections between movies using any actor.\\n\\nFireback Movies is a casual game where players can take their turns when they want. Fireback Movies checks your connections by referencing its proprietary database of 250,000 movies. It knows when there is more than one connection even when you do not. When players take their turns, the app gives immediate feedback to support the option for rapid-fire play. The actors who connect movies are shown after each play.\\n\\nUnlike most trivia games, Fireback Movies lets you show your personality. In Fireback Movies, players play movies they are familiar with. As opponents reveal their movie knowledge, you learn about them. A game against one friend is a different experience from one against another.\\n\\nPlays in Fireback Movies are strategic. Some connected movies score more points than others. If you can play a movie with different actor connections from the last play, it is called a Change Connection and gets the most bonus points.

Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponents pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changes situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play or when he has no more GIPF-pieces on the board.\\n\\nAim\\nThe first player to create a situation where his opponent either has no more pieces in his reserve or no more GIPF-pieces on the board, wins the game. So, keep in mind: make sure to always have at least one piece in reserve and always at least one GIPF-piece on the board. \\n\\nPieces\\nThe players start with 18 pieces in reserve each. Pieces in reserve are pieces of your own color that are not in play. A GIPF-piece is 2 pieces stacked one upon another. \\n\\nThe board \\nThere are 24 dots at the edges of the pattern on the board. Dots are not part of the play area; they serve to position a piece before bringing it into play. The play area is made up of 37 spots (intersections). Only the pieces covering a spot are part of the game. The lines indicate in which directions pieces may be moved. \\n\\nFirst move: GIPF-piece \\nYellow begins. A yellow disk on your side tells you its your turn.\\nYour first move must be a GIPF-piece. Touch and drag a piece out of your reserve and put it on any of the black dots. At your first move, two pieces are sum stacked and moved together. Next push the double (GIPF) piece onto an adjacent spot. You may move a piece only one spot at a time, never two or more. \\n\\nThen the turn of your opponent comes. A red disk on his side indicates it is the red turn. The red player should touch and drag a double (GIPF) piece to an empty black dot. Next push that piece onto an adjacent spot.\\n\\nMoving other pieces\\nBoth players have made one move. When introducing a piece you can either move it to an empty spot, or to an already occupied spot. If the spot is already occupied, that piece is automatically pushed to the next spot on the line (if that spot would also be occupied, then this piece also moves over one spot, etc.)\\n\\nIntroducing single pieces \\nBoth players may introduce as many GIPF-pieces as they want, until they bring a single piece into play. After the first move, every time a player drags a piece into the game, he may choose if a double (GIPF) or a single piece should be moved. After you have inserted a single piece, you have no more choice: all the following moves will insert single pieces. When learning the game, we advise you to play with 3 or 4 GIPF-pieces. \\n\\nTwo restrictions: \\n1. A piece already in play may not be moved as a separate piece. A piece (or more pieces) on the board can only be moved by introducing a new piece. All of the pieces in play may be pushed by both players, black and white pieces, single and GIPF-pieces.\\n2. When all the spots on a line are occupied, you cannot play in the direction of that line. If you would, you would push a piece out of the game at the opposite site and that is not allowed. \\n\\nRecycling and capturing pieces\\nAs soon as 4 single pieces of your color are lined up on adjacent spots (dots dont count!), they are taken from the board. Moreover, not only must these 4 pieces be removed, but also the pieces that form a direct extension of them. The pieces of your own color are returned to your reserve, the pieces of the other color are captured, thus lost to your opponent. Opponents GIPF pieces are automatically removed; your GIPF pieces can be removed or left, at your choice.\\n\\nEnd of a game\\nThere are two ways of winning: you must capture your opponents last GIPF-piece or you must exhaust his reserve. As said in the beginning: a player who has either no more GIPF-pieces on the board, or has no more pieces left to make a move, loses the game.","Developer":"Luigi Fonti","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":727040,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spider-solitaire/id662083994","Name":"Spider-Solitaire","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/81/23/96/8123964e-a098-3067-3161-4c692fa03b92/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Familiar with Windows spider solitaire game for you?

Some moves will free more tiles and that is usually (but not always) a good move. Some moves may cause the board to be unsovable (because all tiles are blocked), but in this situation we provide a couple of Shuffle option to reset the board to a solvable state (the exception is when only 2 tiles are remaining and theyre on top of each other).\\n\\nOver 50 board layout (levels) configurations, all free to play, including the classic/traditional turtle/pyramid board layout/tower.

It features 20 different bullpen sessions. Each bullpen sequence consists of 20 pitches.  All are named according to the goals of the sequence and ranked by difficulty from easiest to hardest. Each session teaches and documents pitch command, selection, and sequencing.  \\n\\nEach bullpen features different methods and strategies of how to get hitters out.  They were all practiced and executed in games to advance Steve Stemle, the inventor of the Lokator Target and System, to the Major Leagues.  They were also crucial tools he used when teaching young pitchers the chess match between the hitter and pitcher while coaching and working at various academies. \\n\\nIn the Bullpen App Blog at www.lokatorpitchingacademy.com he gives descriptions of exactly what pitchers are trying to accomplish during each bullpen and the reasoning behind the method so parents and coaches can relay information to each pitcher while throwing the bullpen. \\n\\nOnce a pitcher creates a profile and selects a bullpen to throw its time to play ball.  The target screen will display the pitch number in the sequence, what Lokations to aim at, and which pitch to throw.  Below this information a Lokator Target will have targeted zones highlighted making visualization and communication easy for the scorekeeper. \\n\\nWhen the pitch is thrown at the designated Lokation\\xa0a teammate, coach, parent, (scorekeeper) will touch the target on the screen where the ball actually hit.\\xa0\\xa0The App will show a check if the Lokation is hit or an X if it is not.  This is where the retries function comes into play.\\n\\nPitchers have the option to choose between 1 and 4 retries for missed targets on the bullpen selection screen.  If pitchers choose the 0 retry option, then bullpens will always be 20 pitches.  If they were to choose 4 retries, then its possible that the bullpen could be 80 pitches long if no Lokations were hit.  This feature enables pitchers to make adjustments from pitch to pitch, throw longer bullpens, and get rewarded for hitting Lokations early and often when competing for a high ranking by Lokator Score.   \\n\\nIn addition to the retry feature on the bullpen selection screen there is also a distance option to select how far each pitcher is from the target.  This comes in handy for pitchers who throw at different distances or if pitchers are not throwing from full distance so everybody is on the same playing field.\\n  \\nWhen the bullpen has been completed, statistics in four categories are automatically stored in the App database. Two of the categories use the Lokator Score to judge effectiveness and rank each pitcher according to targets hit and the number of pitches it took to hit each target.  The remaining two reports are Accuracy Reports.  The first one gives a percentage of total targets hit for each individual bullpen and the other gives percentages of hits for each individual target of the Lokator design.      \\n\\nAfter the Bullpen is over and the reports have been generated, check to see how well you did with Lokator Scores and Accuracy Reports. Look at how you are matching up against other pitchers on the team or friends in the neighborhood with report rankings. \\xa0Then use the email function to report statistics to anyone right from the Report Screen.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Lokator Bullpen will guide pitchers through all Lokations with every pitch in a way that doesnt favor just the pitchers strengths.  When pitchers enter the Lokator Bullpen they get the most well rounded bullpen session possible and we know from experience that this is the best way to improve.","Developer":"THE LOKATOR PITCHING ACADEMY LLC","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":73735168,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stand-ofood-city-virtual-frenzy/id672707752","Name":"Stand O\\u2019Food\\xae City: Virtual Frenzy","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/cc/b6/1b/ccb61bef-f998-7122-0299-5d0d4b183fb5/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Ready to build a burger dynasty?

PLAY NUMBERS NO ONE ELSE IS PLAYING\\u203c Smarter Quick Pick is designed to find you those numbers. It eliminates common patterns people use\\u2014such as dates\\u2014giving you confidence you won\\t be sharing your prize!\\n\\nImagine - you wait your whole life for that big lottery jackpot. You finally win, and guess what? You have to share your prize with other winners! Can\\t be avoided, right? Actually, yes it can!\\n\\nThe first thing to understand when playing the lottery is that every ticket has the same chance of winning. Yes, even 1-2-3-4-5*6! I know this sounds crazy, but there was actually a lottery drawing in Germany that came up 2-3-4-5-6*26. And guess what happened? Over 38,000 people had to split that jackpot!\\n\\nThat\\s when it hit me: People have systems for picking lottery numbers, and if I can avoid those patterns, I can drastically increase my odds of not having to share the winnings!\\n\\nHave you ever wondered why so many lottery jackpots have multiple winners, while so many other drawings have no winners at all? You\\ve probably seen it many times: big jackpot, millions of players, and no one wins. Drawing after drawing, no winners. And the jackpot grows and grows. Then finally one drawing has 2...3...sometimes even 5 winners - all at once! Why is that??\\n\\nThe secret is in the drawings that had no winners. If you look at those numbers, you will see something amazing - no patterns! No dates, no anniversaries - nothing in particular that would have made someone want to use those numbers. These are the types of numbers you want to play!!\\n\\nWe have analyzed these patterns and designed Smarter Quick Pick specifically to avoid them. Smarter Quick Pick will give you numbers to play that have a low liklihood of being played by others. After all, why would you play numbers that other people are playing??\\n\\nYou may be wondering why you need this app when lotteries already have Quick Pick... Well, you should never use a lottery\\s built-in Quick Pick\\u203c Here are two very good reasons why:\\n\\n\\u25b6 Reason #1: You may actually be increasing your odds of having to share! Computers cannot generate random numbers on their own - they need a starting point (or \\u201cseed\\u201d) number \\u2013 and most of them use the time of day. Quick Picks are generated on the spot by the local lottery terminal. These terminals operate independently, using the current date & time to help them decide what your random numbers will be. With potentially hundreds of other people buying tickets at that moment across the region, the chances of getting the same numbers as someone else go up.\\n\\n\\u25b6 Reason #2: Quick Picks do not eliminate numbers and patterns people use often. You want to play random numbers, yes \\u2013 but only to a point. You also want to eliminate sets of numbers and patterns that people commonly use. Standard Quick Pick does not do this for you. Smarter Quick Pick does!\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n\\u2022 Works for all major lotteries around the world\\u203c\\n\\u2022 Utilizes online atmospheric noise data to calculate random numbers\\n\\u2022 Will very likely never display the same numbers twice\\u203c","Developer":"Baby Toga Software","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":11223040,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metropolis-tower-block-build-your-future-dream-city/id686270145","Name":"Metropolis Tower Block - Build Your Future Dream City","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/59/c6/50/59c650b8-2216-6624-9c82-d23fdd428888/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Check out our latest free game app, Coin Dozer Adventures!\\n\\nCan you build the highest skyscraper in the city of Metropolis before it comes tumbling down?

Enjoy!\\n\\nScotland Yard Master is the new development in the world-famous classic board game Scotland Yard, which was named Game of the Year in 1983. \\n\\nTogether with the board game, this app offers a completely new and even more exciting way to play. The detectives are on the cutting edge of technology and even hotter on the heels of Mr X. They will find all the important information in the digital control centre: Which modes of transport has Mr X travelled by so far? When will he show himself again? What special actions can be used? You can select mobile phone tracking, for example, and point the smartphone or tablet\\u2019s camera at the four radio masts on the game board. Green, yellow or red radio waves will indicate whether or not Mr X is nearby. You can also question witnesses at important buildings across the city. The camera comes into play again, showing Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral in 3D. Witnesses will reveal whether Mr X is or has recently been there. \\n\\nFurthermore, the detectives can determine his possible locations by analysing his previous moves, or by measuring the distance between Mr X and the nearest radio mast. But if you think you\\u2019ve already got Mr X in the bag, you can think again. With his new escape option, the helicopter, he\\u2019s as cunning as ever. He can also win the game by reaching two of five pre-determined rendezvous points.\\n\\nThe innovative combination of the classic board game and digital gaming fun guarantees an engrossing experience for the whole family!","Developer":"Ravensburger Digital GmbH","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":236194816,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/missile-defense-japan/id687066393","Name":"Missile Defense Japan","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/16/dc/ab/16dcabec-dc77-7fa7-f9bc-2d1be1c40b2d/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"[FREE] ACTION GAME\\n\\nBallistic missile are incoming.\\nIntercept and save Japan!\\n\\nIts simple to play.\\nOperation:\\n1.

The car drives through lovely gardens for over seventy meters, but when it stops at the mansion\\u2019s front entrance, nobody steps out of the vehicle, as the butler patiently waits at the ready to welcome the vehicle\\u2019s occupants. \\n\\nThe sound of someone shouting can be heard when the car door opens after a few minutes.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the last time I\\u2019m putting up with your slurs and your insults, yelled Louis Versetti, son of the multimillionaire Paolo Versetti.\\n\\nVery slowly and calmly, Louis\\u2019 father steps out of the car after his son; he doesn\\u2019t follow him, he just looks at him with a hard and dismissive stare. \\n\\nYou think I don\\u2019t deserve any of this.

No one makes a single sound; the only thing to be heard is the sound the shoes make as they walk down the paved driveway; those fine shoes which were manufactured in Italy, his father\\u2019s native land. His father came to this country when he was very young and single-handedly became a millionaire in just ten years by creating multiple companies.\\n\\nLouis is about to reach the gate, and all he\\u2019s taking with him to face the world on his own is just a leather jacket and some money in his wallet.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll show him what I can accomplish on my own, thinks the 23-year-old, who feels he is ready to forge his own path in life. \\n\\n Before leaving the grounds, he turns a little to the right to look at the small storage shed where old things are kept, and where he knows his old motorcycle is stored. It\\u2019s been years since he last used it, so it must be very dusty and maybe even a little rusty, but Louis is almost certain that it still works. \\n\\nAlthough Louis had been determined to leave on foot, he thinks it will be much better on that bike.

It is like a virtual pet or Tamagotchi game on a planetary level.  Play God by manipulating the sunlight and the rain in order to grow as large a population as possible.  \\n\\nMy Planet runs in real time, even when the the game is closed.  Therefore, you must keep checking back throughout the day to make sure your planet is running at optimal levels.  The controls are simple to use, by mastery can take weeks.  Can you achieve the ultimate goal of growing your planet to over 1,000,000 people?  Or will your planet burn under the sun while your people anguish?  The choice is yours!\\n\\nThe ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline. \\n\\nVegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water. If you have too much, vegetation will flood out and die. To little, and drought will set in. Check your planet every day to make sure you have the optimal amount of sun and water!\\n\\nI am always looking to improve my apps, so if you have any ideas on how to make My Planet better, please let me know.

Spa\\xdf garantiert!\\n\\n- Wir sind ganz nebenbei auch die graphisch sch\\xf6nste Schnapsen-App der Welt. 4 verschiedene Kartendecks von Comic \\xfcber Doppeldeutsch bis zu Riesensymbolen f\\xfcr den kurzsichtigen Kartenspieler und 4 verschiedene Hintergr\\xfcnde von der Wiese bis zum Beisl machen dieses Schnapsen zu einem h\\xfcbschen und vielseitigen Erlebnis. \\n\\n- Die Schnapsen App orientiert sich an den g\\xe4ngigen Spielregeln. 1er, 2er, 3er, 20, 40, Bubentausch, zuadrahn, 66 \\u201edanke genug\\u201c.

I have played SHG games for years. Best one yet ... awesome job guys!! \\n\\n-Wicked Space Game If you like SyFy then you should enjoy this game.\\n\\n-Addictive and full of hidden depths This is a simple game. Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\\s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.\\n\\n-Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies. \\n\\nReview from one of the Game Creators\\nAs one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\\s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\\s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works. \\n\\nI love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.

Zhou Yu, the chief military commander of the Wu Kingdom, ordered Zhu Ge Liang (the chief minister of the Shu Kingdom and generally regarded as the kingdom\\s top master-mind) to produce 100,000 arrows within 10 days. \\nThree days is enough,  said Zhu. He also aGREed to be punished if he failed to complete the order. \\n\\nZhou mocked that Zhu was looking for self-destruction. On the one hand, Zhou ordered his troops not to provide Zhu with materials to make the arrows. He also sent Lu Su to see how Zhu was dealing the problem. \\n\\nIn fact, Zhu had already realized that this was a plot. He asked Lu (who was kind-hearted) to lend him 20 boats, each lined with straw scarecrows and manned by 30 soldiers. He also requested that Lu not tell Zhou what was happening. \\n\\nWhen Lu came again to see Zhu, he did not find anything unusual. Nothing happened on the second day either. In the early morning of the third day, Zhu invited Lu for a boat ride. The 20 boats were tied together with strong ropes. Zhu\\s fleet sailed toward the camp of Cao Cao (who was the king of the Wei Kingdom). \\n\\nA thick mist had spread over the surface of the river. People could hardly see each other on the river. When Zhu\\s fleet got close to the Cao camp before dawn, Zhu ordered his soldiers to shout and beat drums to fake an attack. Zhu and Lu simply sat inside one of the boats and drank wine to enjoy themselves. \\n\\nAs soon as the Cao camp heard the shouting and drum beating, they mistook it for a surprise attack by the Zhou camp. Since they could see nobody on the river, they gathered 3,000 bowmen and ordered them to shoot arrows. The front of the scarecrows was quickly shot full of arrows. \\n\\nAfter a while, Zhu had his fleet turn around to expose the other side of the scarecrows. When this side was also shot full of arrows, the day broke. Zhu ordered his soldiers to return to their base port. The soldiers shouted, Thank you, Cao, for your arrows. After they got back to their camp, they collected more than 100,000 arrows from the scarecrows.","Developer":"JUN ZHU","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":22847488,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/battle-fortress-war/id719394052","Name":"Battle Fortress War","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/11/9e/c8/119ec8c7-f5ae-900f-9605-8414b046c793/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Battle for WORLD DOMINATION over progressive Age\\u2019s, beginning in the Stone Age, and advancing all the way through to the Space Age (if you survive!).

It requires players to be able to calculate a variety of possible moves quickly while planning several moves in advance. \\n\\n\\nNumber War is a very simple game. It really has one rule. \\n\\nA played die captures/scores any lower value die in the ROW AND COLUMN it is played in. The Player scores the total value of all captured dice, and the captured dice change to the value of the played die. \\n\\n\\n\\n100% Free 1 Player & 2 Player Gaming! \\n\\n\\n4 Game Variations: \\n\\n\\nNumber War Standard \\n\\nQuick Rules \\n\\n1. A Played Die captures & scores the total value of any dice of LOWER value in BOTH the ROW & COLUMN it is played in. \\n\\n2. Captured dice are changed to the value of the played die but stay on the board. A Played die Does Not score any dice of Equal or Greater value. \\n\\n3. Highest Score Wins. \\n\\n\\nNumber War Plus \\n\\nThe Value of the played Die is added to any scoring play. Non scoring plays recive no points. \\n\\n\\nNumber War Domino \\n\\nNumber War Dominos style. Die MUST be placed adjacent to a die on the board. Any of the 8 squares around a die on the board is a legal play. \\n\\n\\nNumber War Twisted \\n\\nTry scoring the LEAST amount of points. Same rules, just the completely opposite Goal! Extremely challenging. \\n\\n\\n2 Skill Levels \\n\\n\\nBEGINNER - Easier AI. Dice are played in neutral color making it easy to count how many sevens have been played. \\n\\nExpert - Difficult AI. Dice get played in their respective Number War color requiring players to remember what has been played. \\n\\n\\n3 Dice Variations \\n\\nChoose to play with 1, 3, or 5 dice in hand. \\n\\n\\nADJUSTABLE TIMER \\n\\nSet turn time to 15, 30, or 60 seconds. \\n\\n\\nMULTIPLAYER via GAME CENTER \\n\\nPlay your friends or people from around the world via Game Center. \\n\\n\\n\\nLEADERBOARDS & RANKING SYSTEM \\n\\nOne Player Leaderboard - See who is best against the computer.

How much they get is dependent upon how well they played. \\n\\nNot only does Number War have a two player leaderboard for every variation and an overall grand master leader, but also a unique leader point system that rewards great losing play more than easy victories. \\n\\nWell played games are awarded more points to split between players. Close games split the point nearly evenly. Thus playing a hard fought, well played game that ends in defeat gives both the winner and loser more leader points than a winner in a poorly played blowout. \\n\\nFinally a game leaderboard that recognizes that a well played loss deserves nearly as much recognition as a well played victory! \\n\\nOnly by quitting a match will you receive no leaderboard points. So do your best and even in defeat you will be rewarded! \\n\\n\\nBest of all, the basic game app is FREE for Iphone, Ipod & Ipad!

Become a public transport tycoon and enjoy this nontraditional strategy and time management game. Play through the history from 1960 up to 2020, buy many of different buses, upgrade the stations and find the best strategy to achieve all trophies in time. \\n\\nCitizens expect comfort buses and this is important - do not let them order a taxi! Each bus offers specific number of capacity, price and XP points for each transported passenger. City is changing each level so you will need your brain. Be a smart director and organize your pocket bus imperium wisely.\\n\\nTired of tons of confusing tables during growing your virtual business yet? This simulation game is really easy to control, tutorial is short, clever and multilanguage so you will enjoy the challenge in the first early moments. \\n\\nGet this sweet and addictive game and transport them all!\\n\\nSTRATEGY TIPS:\\n- UNDERSTANDING THE CITY\\nFrom the very first moment of the level you should watch the buildings! The taller building you are looking at, the bigger potential it has! Taller buildings offer more passengers. So your first line should be going through these huge buildings!\\n\\n- PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING\\nCitizens want to be transported! Anyhow. If there is no line created by your company, they will choose a taxi. And this is the point! Each passenger gives you the XP you need for the trophies and winning each level! Taxi on the board means you have lost 20 passengers! A lot of XP! Like the previous paragraph said: a bigger building equals more passengers.\\n\\n- XP UNDERSTANDING\\nEach bus gives you a specific number of XP for each transported passenger. Think about it, deeply. When you buy a bus with 7 XP and you loose 20 passengers (1 person on the board), it means 140 XP. Try not to lose too much XP.\\n\\n- CHOOSING CORRECT STARTING LINE\\nAs stated you should explore the city at the beginning. Start your first line on the place where there are a lot of bigger buildings! Bigger buildings mean a lot of potencial lost passengers (stolen by the taxi). This is really important to think about!\\n\\n- CHOOSING CORRECT VEHICLE\\nAre you purchasing the buses without thinking about their price and capacity? This is crucial. XP is not everything in the very first moments! You have probably bought the best possible bus at the beginning (because you want as much XP as possible) but your station capacity is only 20 passengers (without upgrades). This is the issue! A bus with huge capacity is useless when you don\\xb4t upgrade the stations (it serves 20 more people per each upgrade). So where is the point? You will be doing well with bus with small capacity and price at the beginning. Small XP earnings are not important in the beginning! First of all you need money for better buses in the near future! You can earn a lot of money with cheaper buses in the beginning! That\\xb4s why cash is important! Buy better buses after some time. Expensive buses with huge capacity make sense only if you can serve a bigger number of passengers at the stations! Always think about the ratio between the capacity of a station and the capacity of a bus! A wrong strategy can consupt your money and then your XP by the taxis!\\n\\n- UPGRADING THE STATIONS\\nThis paragraph is linked to previous. Imagine you have bought a bus with a small capacity. So there is no sense to upgrade the stations to their maximum while you are saving money for better buses! Station upgrades are expensive! Upgrade the stations after buying a new bus. Immediately, if possible.\\n\\n- SELLING OLD TRAMS\\nThe best strategy is to sell your buses after they have reached their final station. Let the buses serve all passengers on their line. Then sell them before reaching their depot when an accident occurs.","Developer":"Daniel Viktorin","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":22462464,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindmap-mind-mapping-for-draft-diagram/id725222275","Name":"MindMap - Mind Mapping for Draft & Diagram","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/04/dc/30/04dc3051-6538-17f8-1f52-4eaf45a7d087/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Mindmap  lets you easily enter ideas, tasks, and meeting notes into intuitive visual maps that help you quickly organize concepts and prioritize action items. \\nHighlights\\nFinger Slide Topic Creation \\nJust tap a topic and slide your finger to create a new topic!
