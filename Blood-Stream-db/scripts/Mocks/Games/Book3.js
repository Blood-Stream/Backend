Once you have placed your tile in the target place, if in some of the adjacent places there are blue tiles with lower numbers, they will automatically be changed to red.

And if there are red tiles with lower values in the adjacent places, they will be changed to blue, and so on.  When the board is full, red and blue tiles are counted.

Battle other players online controlling huge space fleets ranging from small fighters to gigantic battlecruisers. Play the single player campaign or train against the AI.  GAMEPLAY  Galactic Conflict is a competitive SciFi RTS with a gameplay similar to Starcraft or Command & Conquer. You start out on your homeworld, build up your economy to gain valuable resources to research better technology and of course an impressive space fleet. Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \\u2013 either online or against the AI.  Galactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time. Ships come at all sizes: watch small fighters and corvettes dog-fighting for strikecraft supremacy, bombers swarming enemy ships, frigates hypering in to lay waste to an enemy planet or unleash the tremendous firepower of the huge capital ships.  SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN  Enjoy the single player campaign where the Terran Confederation\\u2019s home planet has been attacked by the mysterious Pyros race without prior notice. Only a small fleet of Terrans could survive the cowardly attack and they are now on the run. Join the terran space fleet in 12 immersive missions, help protect the only survivors of the human race and find the best strategies to repel the invaders.  SKIRMISH AGAINST THE AI  Play against AI opponents in four different difficulty settings in numerous galaxies to shape up for multiplayer. Experiment with new strategies, learn your preferred race and work on your timings to outsmart the opponent.  INTENSIVE MULTIPLAYER ACTION  Challenge your friends in a 1v1 or 2v2 on Game Center or get automatically matched to other players on the Internet.

GAME BALANCE  Galactic Conflict features two distinct races each having 13 different space ships. It is easy to control on a touch device even for newcomers to strategy games but still provides good strategic depth for real-time strategy fans. We all know that in strategy games, the meta-game shifts as new strategies are discovered by innovative players and this needs continuous small adjustments to the gameplay often referred to as \\u201cbalancing the game\\u201d. The game was made by experienced, passionate real-time strategy players and as such, we are dedicated to keep the game balanced for the best multiplayer experience.

THE ULTIMATE IPAD STRATEGY GAME : GENESIA LITE !  This new version of GENESIA is inspired from the game of the same name I created twenty years ago on Amiga 500. GENESIA, named Ultimate Domain in the USA, is a turn based strategic game that received the \\xab Tilt d\\u2019or \\xbb in 1993 for the best strategic game facing the challengers of the time such as \\xab Dune 2 \\xbb and \\xab Starlord \\xbb.   100% REWRITTEN WITH OPTIMIZED TOOLS FOR IPAD 2   GENESIA\\u2019s programming has been entirely re-thought and re-written according to Objective C, whilst maintaining the philosophy and original title of the game.    A \\xab BALLSY \\xbb GAME DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS HARD TO PLEASE   GENESIA is not an easy game. Contrary to \\xab Gameplay \\xbb where everything is pre-cooked and where your hand is being held to redirect you every two minutes, here there is no tutorial obligating you to do this or that in order to advance.   In GENESIA, there are no mind blowing special effects. I preferred to keep my focus on the deepness and interest of the game.   AN \\xab OLD FASHIONED \\xbb GAME, WITH REAL \\xab TURN BASED \\xbb BITS IN THEM !   One year is divided into four seasons and each season corresponds to one round in the game. In the beginning of each round, little time is given to you to elaborate your strategies and distribute your orders, before passing to your opponent\\u2019s hand.   You can do what you want at any given moment whenever you feel the need to. Being quick or slow isn\\u2019t a problem, at any given moment the situations can permute and a well played hand can change the unravelling of the round. A situation that seems completely hopeless to you can, armed with patience and strategy, turn around to your favor.   TACTICAL COMBAT, MANAGEMENT, ADVENTURE AND \\xab GEMS \\xbb !   GENESIA isn\\u2019t a simple race against time. You will always have several ways to do what must be done, and step by step, you will sharpen your tactics. To achieve victory, you will have to develop your economy\\u2019s politics and accumulate resources that will enable you to recruit soldiers to find as fast as you can gems of NEORT.   GENESIA \\xab IT\\u2019S ALIVE \\xbb !   To evolve in GENESIA, you will have to act as harmoniously as possible. Several crafts are at your disposal to build this New World : farmers, lumberjacks, blacksmiths, carpenters, soldiers... But all of this won\\u2019t be done easily for other Governors are striving just as you, on other territories. It\\u2019s your economy\\u2019s development, your military force and technological advancement that will lead you to the term of your engagement.   As in every society, your people aspire to happiness and have their own lives. They work, pay taxes, get married, have children, age... and are even subject to diseases.   \\u2022 Flowers favor the presence of pollinating insects, the tree roots stabilize the grounds, and vegetation develops accordingly to the natural environment.  \\u2022 The sea, the rain, the storms, the snow melts, drinking water wells influence the groundwater.  \\u2022 The seasons have a direct impact on the exploitation of the natural resources.   GENESIA IS YOUR GAME, FOR A LONG TIME   This new version is the first stone to building an empire that we can create together. It will take time and GENESIA will evolve during the following months.

All of the known lands are subject to his brutal command. Everyone who speaks out, who misbehaves, who doesn\\u2019t fit in is cast into the dark, volcanic pits of Avernum, far below the surface. There, you are expected to die, a victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair.  But not all of the Avernites have surrendered.

You are in charge of a special wildlife reserve where you have the important task of revitalizing the land and building a vibrant habitat for Terrapets; mysterious creatures who are the embodiment of the environments that they inhabit. Terrapets from the swamplands are sneaky and vitriolic, while those from the woodlands are steadfast and strong. If the environment is harsh and unforgiving then so too are the Terrapets that live there.   There was a time when Terrapets were numerous, but not anymore. You have the power within your hands to return the world to what it once was. You can revitalize Hakawa with a range of different terrain types and customize the environment as you see fit. From frozen tundra and volcanic mountains to thick forests and vast oceans, you have many different options for creating an enticing reservation for all the different Terrapets.

We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package. Hearts is trick-taking playing card game for 4 players, no teams and no trump suit. The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game. The object of the game is to avoid taking points. When the first player reaches 100 points, the player with the lowest number of points is the winner.  In hearts each heart card is worth 1 point and the queen of spades is worth 13 points, which is as much as all of the other cards combined. At the beginning of round, the players choose three cards to pass to a random player. The player with the 2 of clubs must lead the first trick with the 2 of clubs. For each trick a player must follow suit unless he does not have a card of that suit. Because there is no trump, a player can not win a trick if he passes a card of any suit other than the suit lead. Hearts can not be lead until hearts are broken - after the first heart card has been played. If a player takes every point in a round, he \\u201cShoots the Moon\\u201d and he receives 0 points for the round while all other players receive 26 points.

If you not familiar with the rules of Mahjong Solitaire game, the this app is a good introduction, because this app is easy to play. The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for beginner to intermediate. The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.  The rules of the game is simple: - You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called pyramid or turtle solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others.  - To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them. - Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked.  A tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\\s no tiles above it. - You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\\s no more tiles that can be moved.  Sounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\\ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked.   As mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not free, which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\\t be moved because there\\s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.  Features: - Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you matching pictures of painted Easter eggs. - Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike. - The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included.  - Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it. - Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\\s a match possible). - Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will free some of the previously blocked tiles.

The former version was no longer compatible with iOS 11 (it wouldn\\t start or crash in most cases). The code base of the former version was too old to just be updated which is why we needed to rebuild the game from scratch. We used this opportunity to also implement a multiplayer mode and update the graphics.  How can I play the former / old version of Backgammon?  You can only play the old version if you don\\t update the game and use a device that uses iOS 10.3.3 or lower.   Where is the Undo button? After your first move, there will be a circular arrow pointing to the left, at the bottom right of the board. Tapping the arrow will undo your move.  ________________   You can find our general terms and conditions here: http://tc.lite.games ...and our privacy policy here: http://privacy.lite.games  Visit us for more free iPhone and iPad games:  https://www.lite.games https://www.facebook.com/LiteGames  Or give us your app feedback here: support@lite.games  Thanks for playing!', Developer: 'LITE Games GmbH', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 153778176, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-score-pad/id518018730', Name: 'Chess Score Pad', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/06/36/a2/0636a21d-63c5-e67b-60f9-7e2d5d6e2e8c/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'For chess players who want the ease and accuracy of an electronic scoresheet at an affordable price, now there is Chess Score Pad.

Black has the top row, bottom row goal areas; and White has the left column and right column goal areas.   The first player who can establish a network linking its two goal areas wins the game.  A network is a series of six of more pieces that starts from one goal areas and ends in the other.  Each consecutive pair of pieces in the series are joined to each other along either horizontal, vertical or diagonal straight paths.   An opponents piece placed in any cell on the path between the two pieces breaks the path.  Although more than one piece may be placed in a goal area, a network can only be made with a starting piece in one goal area and an ending piece in the other goal area.  A network cannot utilize pieces from the same goal area.   A network cannot go through a piece more than once.   A network cannot go through a piece without turning. Paths that has no change in direction cannot be part of the network . The players alternate taking turns, with White moving first.  Rules of legal play are: - The four corners are not played - Cannot place a piece into a cell that is already taken - The opponents goal areas are off-limits - Cannot place a piece into a cell that would result in three or more of its own color pieces form adjacent cluster.   A group of three pieces form a cluster if one of them is adjacent (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) to the other two. Each player takes turns to place the pieces on the board.  If neither player has won when all 20 pieces are on the board, each play takes turn to move a piece to another cell, subject to the same restrictions.   A player must make a move to a different cell.  Lifting a piece may unblock a connection between opponent pieces.  If after the piece is placed at the new location, it breaks the network at some other point, the opponent does not win.  However, if the move completes a network for the opponent, the player making the move loses, even if that move causes both players to complete the network.

Without treatment, the bubonic plague kills about two thirds of infected humans within 4 days. The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word \\u03b2\\u03bf\\u03c5\\u03b2\\u03ce\\u03bd, meaning groin. Swollen lymph nodes (buboes) especially occur in the armpit and groin in persons suffering from bubonic plague. Bubonic plague was often used synonymously for plague, but it does in fact refer specifically to an infection that enters through the skin and travels through the lymphatics, as is often seen in flea-borne infections.', Developer: 'Mashal Abdullah', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 20320256, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridge-scoring/id532983998', Name: 'Bridge Scoring', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/b8/0b/ae/b80baea3-ac99-2b6f-44a3-476552c20011/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Make it simple!

A summary of the rules appears below:   1. Construct bridges between islands such that each island has the proper number of bridges attached to it. 2. Bridges can placed in a horizontal or vertical orientation and may not overlap. 3. You can have at most two bridges directly connecting one island to another. 4. The network of bridges must connect each island to every other island.  In other words, if you pick any island in the puzzle you should be able to walk from it to any other island by travelling over the bridges.   It couldn\\t be much simpler than that.  And yet, hidden behind these simplistic rules you\\ll find some devilishly challenging puzzles. Or, if casual puzzling is more your speed, the small puzzles will nicely satisfy your cravings without tying your brain in knots.  Speaking of brains, Hashi includes a Daily Challenge to keep you mentally sharp.  The Daily Challenge tracks your best score over different time periods allowing you to compete against a very worthy adversary: yourself.   We hope you enjoy Hashi.

It was invented by the ancient Hawaiian Polynesians. The game begins with all the counters laid out on the board in an alternating pattern of black and white. Players then hop over one anothers pieces capturing them similar to checkers. The first player who can no longer make a capture is the loser, and the other player is the winner. In ancient times, the pieces used were black and white lava stones played over a large rock which doubled as a board and table. The game appears somewhat similar to draughts. Pieces hop over one another when capturing. However, the similarities end there. In draughts, one players pieces are initially set up on one side of the board opposite the other players pieces. In Konane, both players pieces are intermixed in an alternating pattern of black and white that covers the whole board. Furthermore, in Konane all moves are capturing moves, and they are done in an orthogonal direction (not diagonally).', Developer: 'POK', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 3342336, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/war-room/id541409129', Name: 'War Room', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/f9/1a/fd/f91afde1-d18e-dd34-9c43-b6e6ecf0e408/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'A Message From Privateer:  With the announcement of the new editions for WARMACHINE and HORDES, we have disabled Mk II faction deck and bundle purchases in War Room.

Rack the balls with a powerful break shot. Impress your friends your billiard playing skill! You don\\u2019t have to buy an expensive pool table just to enjoy fun and addictive pool party with your friends. Just download our app and play for FREE!   Do you love to play billiard? Have you ever dreamed of becoming a biliard or snooker master, playing bilyard on a pool live tour across the country? Maybe you even dream of participating in the World Pool Championship. To become a maestro, you must practice and play against tough opponents to sharpen your snooker skill. The problem is, like most people, you probably don\\u2019t have access to a pool table 24/7.  However, you can still practice your skills by playing virtual 8ball pool on your iOS device. You can practice with your friends or random players who also enjoy playing snoker as much as you do.   Some people like to play 9 ball pool and some people enjoy 8ball pool games. In Pool with Friends, the game you can play is the 8 ball pool version. The rule of the game is slightly different than the 9 ball version. For example, in the 8ball version, you may not put the opponent\\u2019s balls into the pockets. By playing this game, you will be able to practice and learn about the rules of the game easily.   ============================================================= TOP FEATURES OF POOL WITH FRIENDS \\u2013 EIGHT BALL POOL MULTIPLAYER:  =============================================================  #MULTIPLAYER BILLIARD GAME  Play with your friends offline or play with random players online.  You can also play against yourself to practice your shots.     #REALISTIC 3D SIMULATOR  Pool with Friends uses an advanced and realistic physic simulator. You will see how the balls move on the pool table when you hit the ball with different strength and direction. Enjoy playing as if you are pool billiards pro.     #BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC GRAPHIC  We handcrafted the game graphic to make it look realistic and sharp. The graphic will help you determine how to make the best and most accurate shot.   #LEARN ABOUT THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE PLAYING  After your turn, we will check the table and inform you if you\\u2019ve committed a foul. We will also inform you the name of the foul. For example Scratch is a foul when a player pockets the white ball. As the result, the opponent can choose where to place the white ball. This is a great way to memorize the rule of the 8 ball pool game.   #SMOOTH GAMEPLAY AND GAME CONTROL  To play this game, first tap on the table to place the ball to rack. Then adjust the direction and the strength. Tap on the Hit button to hit the white ball. It\\u2019s a very easy and straightforward gameplay, but it\\u2019s not easy to master. You need to practice to understand the physic of the game and how the ball moves when you hit using certain level of strength to a certain direction.  Play pool (8 Ball) with your friends around the world. Using turn based multiplayer, you can have multiple games going at the same time. Requires GameCenter and internet to play. Featuring realistic physics, great graphics, standard rules, fun gameplay and highscores. Warning: Quitting the game after you hit the white ball and before your turn is over will result in a loss.

As is, you are skating on thin ice.  Without the money, the mob bosses can\\u2019t build the super crime hotel and park that they need to raise money for defense of the big battle that is to come with the zombies.  And they have hired you to raise this capital.  The problem is that that the best gold is located at the top of the tower, in the dangerous kingdom of Boogly the dragon , and the mechanical pickers that transport your treasure chests are already working overtime while they travel through every village and city.  Being so overworked, they might just drop a crate on your head, so be careful!  You are just a tiny pirate, young of age, and your business and mission in this life of crime is to smuggle as many amazing treasure crates out of the dragon lord kingdom as possible.

But time is running out, and you are on a race to smuggle and ship as many crates as possible before the other monster nations catch up to you.  You have to cut every corner possible.  But avoid the pitfall of building the stacks too high, or you may get stuck in between them.  You can\\u2019t kick down the crates or draw strength from some mystical source to overpower and push them around.  No, you have to be smart and strategic with their placement.  To ship the crates, you need to stack them like you stack blocks.  Stack a full row as you skate side to side and once a full row is completed, ship them off across the ocean water.  Something tells you that you better be fast, or the monster mob will be paying you a visit.

It is interesting mostly because it was coded entirely on an iPad in Lua using the Codea application from Two Lives Left.  The sprites in the game were drawn using Spritely, the sprite editor which comes with Codea.  The source code for this game and a description of how it was built is available for download at the Codea Tutorial site (http://codeatuts.blogspot.com.au/)  OBJECTIVE:  The objective of the game is to clear the grid without tapping any of the mines. If you tap a mine the game is over.  INSTRUCTIONS:  From the menu you can select Easy, Medium or Hard games. The difference in difficulty is determined by the size of the game grid and the number of mines.  Easy - grid dimensions 8x8 with 8 mines Medium - grid dimensions 15x15 with 30 mines Hard - grid dimension 18x18 with 60 mines  The game screen shows the number of cells not cleared in the top left hand corner and game duration on the right. Tapping on the game grid will reveal either an empty square or a mine.  The first tap is a gamble. In this version of Minesweeper it is possible for your first tap to be on a mine. Mines are placed randomly in different positions each game. If there are no mines surrounding the cell you tap then all of these cells will also be revealed at the same time. If there is a number in a revealed cell this indicates the number of mines in the surrounding cells. You can use this information to deduce the location of the mines.  Mathematically it has been shown that the highest chance of clearing multiple cells is by tapping in a corner.  There are three buttons on the game screen:  Show/Flag: Tapping the shovel or flag icon at the bottom of the screen will toggle between show and flag mode. In show mode, tapping a cell will reveal it. In flag mode, tapping a cell will place a flag on it, indicating there may be a mine underneath. You dont have to use flags but they make the game easier to solve.  New: Will reset the grid and start a new game.  Menu: If tapped will take you back to the Menu screen.  HIGHSCORE:  The high score for each of the three game difficulties is stored. You get a high score by solving the grid in the shortest recorded time.', Developer: 'Reefwing Software', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 6858752, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheres-my-penny-free/id554788226', Name: 'Wheres My Penny?

Great for beginners and a challenge for experts. It has beautiful graphics, smooth game play and subtle sound effects.  Sudoku is a number puzzle game where you try to fill in the blanks. Each digit (from 1 to 9) can only appear once in each row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. There is only one solution for each puzzle. Here\\s an example:  If a row looks like this:     1 3 _ 4 5 6 8 9 7 Then the number 2 is the only possible answer for that empty space, because the numbers 13456789 are all already in that row. By looking to see which numbers are already in a row, column and 3x3 sub-grid you can figure out what numbers go in each cell. (It sounds more complicated than it is! The SIMPLE level puzzles make it pretty easy to get started.)  If you love puzzle and card games try my other games too!

Each player controls from one to four survivors, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, survivors hastily change to hunters to smash zombies through and through.

Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between beat up and survival horror as characters keep on turning from prey to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest.  The Zombicide Companion App serves as a digital replacement for the Survival Identity Cards used in the boardgame to keep track of each character\\u2019s equipment inventory, experience and skills. But the app goes beyond that, offering players some cool extra aids as well.  \\u2013 Features \\u2013  \\u2022 A virtual deck of equipment cards allows you to easily control you survivors inventory, switching cards around with a flick of the wrist and no fear of cards slipping around.  \\u2022 Keeping track of your survivor\\u2019s experience has never been easier.

Its training effect is based on the need to make massive manipulations with the elements of the playing table in mind.  Genius Brain intensively develops:  - analytical thinking - accuracy of thinking - both short-term and long-term memory - focus - imagination and creativity  Read more about the simulator.  For each new task, the game table is filled with elements in a random order, but their location is not shown to the user. The clues are shown - a pair of elements and a sign between them. The clue tells how the two elements are located in the table relative to each other. Clues are of several types, for example:  Left - indicated by an arrow pointing to the left, and means that the column of the first clue element is located in the table directly to the left of the column of the second element;  Neighbors - indicated by a double-headed arrow, and means that the clue elements are in the adjacent columns of the game table, but which one is on the left, and which on the right is unknown;  In one column is indicated by an equal sign, and means that the clue elements are strictly in any one column of the game table;  In a specific column is also denoted by an equal sign, but the second clue element is the number of the column in which the first clue element is located.  Despite the unusual shape, the Genius Brain can be considered an ordinary classic puzzle when parts of an image need to be put together. Each clue in the Genius Brain is one of these parts. Therefore, the player\\u2019s goal is to place all clues in an empty (imaginary) table at the same time. After that, the only possible column of the table will be found, in which the element indicated at the bottom of the playing field can be located. This number must be entered at the bottom of the playing field. And it\\s all. If you are not mistaken, you have solved the problem.  Solving the first tasks in the mind can be a serious challenge. Therefore, I recommend using a pencil and paper at the initial stage. But as soon as you get comfortable, I highly recommend solving problems in your mind. It is then that the Genius Brain will reveal its powerful training potential.

(English and German translations available for this deck at this time)  Winner of the 2013 Board Game of the Year from Pocket Tactics!  Europe is recovering from some hard times. You and a spouse must grow your 2-room hut and empty farmyard into a productive farm. You must sow and reap, raise animals and expand your family in order to thrive. Europe in the 17th century: a tough time to be a farmer!  Agricola is a family-friendly strategy game. Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.  Easy To Play Agricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as Wood and Clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.  At harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!  The player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family\\u2019s home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards. Players lose one point for each unused farmyard space.  An award-winning board game and player favorite since 2007, Agricola is now available as a universal game application.  Brought to you by Playdek, Agricola establishes a new benchmark for iPad board gaming.

Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate west or east, and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.  A status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.

Welcome to a complete remake of Dominant Species, our first iPad app. This app is a digital port of one of our best-selling games, designed by Chad Jensen. Our original attempt at an app for this game was unfortunately less-than-stellar (to be kind). We knew we could do better, and we committed to making it better. Regrettably, it took us a long time - and three different developers - to finally create this new version. But at last we have an app that we are REALLY proud of. We hope you guys will like it, too, and find it a major improvement over the original game.  This new app update is an entirely new game with 100% new code, so you guys are getting a completely different app from the original. We are providing it as an \\u201cupdated version\\u201d because that was the only way I could figure out to make sure that the owners of the original could get the new app for free. Please accept this as our apology that the original app wasn\\u2019t better, for the time it took us to get you the new version, and as a demonstration of our determination to never leave you stuck with a game that isn\\u2019t a quality product.  For you players who already play the Dominant Species boardgame, this app will allow you to have fun and practice your skills anytime, against a mix of human and computer AI opponents.    For those of you who are unfamiliar with the boardgame, we provide context-sensitive explanations and a set of online rules to help you learn the game and get started quickly. You can also get help from us directly, via our Facebook page - which we are revamping to support the new version - at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dominant-Species-for-iPad/320893411343198. If you want to learn more strategy or have questions about general game play (not app-related), feel free to ask your questions on our Dominant Species page on BoardgameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62219/dominant-species  Heres an updated feature list. Note that we are working on an additional update which will add multi-player Game Center support.  Features:  Play against a mix of up to 5 human and/or AI opponents via Solo Play, Pass N Play,  or a combination of both. A completely reworked User Interface that makes the game much easier to play New Pull-Out visual menus that provide quick access to Tile Scoring, Speciation Values, Food Chain, and Dominance Cards.

I also want to thank the people who volunteered to help us test Dominant Species, caught many bugs, and gave us great suggestions throughout. You guys did terrific work - thanks!  OK, enough talk.

In this game, you have to rid the screen of all of its invaders.  In order to proceed, send the incoming item from the bottom upward by simply pointing the desired target or direction with your finger. You may make it bounce on the screen sides to reach some otherwise unreachable target.  When playing in EASY mode, you need to hit at least 2 similar items with a corresponding one to make them collapse, taking all the other attached ones down with them.  If you hit a bomb, it will explode, taking all of its neighbors with it.  If you hit a blocker, nothing will happen, except that youll just have another attached item to get rid of to end the game.  If you dont hit enough similar items, the games excitation will grow, as shown by the lower left indicator. When it will reach a given value, a new range of items will appear to the top.  If the item crowd reach the bottom of the screen, you lose.  Now, that was for the EASY mode...  When playing in NORMAL mode, you need to gather 4 similar items to get them to collapse. Even worse: when you hit a blocker, some radioactive fog will appear in order to bother you... The fog will last for around 10 seconds.  Right then, you think: you could just wait for the fog to disappear?  Not exactly: in NORMAL mode, your item gets automatically fired after 6 or 7 seconds, so you have to use your visual memory to fire these before they land in some possibly inconvenient place.  Now about the HARD mode.  It is HARD.  Whenever hitting a blocker, not only will you get some fog to bother you, but the blockers direct neighbors will randomly change color. Ah... and the Auto-Fire delay is reduced by half: both of these particularities will force you to use your reflexes and capacities to readjust your strategy continually to eventually win (which might not occur frequently).  Because the game can be fairly to awfully hard, you might want to publish your score on its leaderboards. There are 18 of these, depending on which difficulty you chose (EASY, NORMAL or HARD), which item size (LARGE, MEDIUM, SMALL), and if you WON (best times) or LOST (best scores).', Developer: 'Callet & Vidovic', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 18357248, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-alchemist-halloween/id568415508', Name: 'Magic Alchemist Halloween', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/32/e1/96/32e196f1-2176-e37f-8281-d047d238b4ac/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Halloween Edition of Magic Alchemist!

Tiles must be placed according to the following rules: 1.  Each turn must use at least 1 tile from the board and 2 tiles from your hand 2.  All adjacent tiles must be part of a true and complete equation 3.  Tiles cannot be moved once they are played 4.  Players may choose to pass and forfeit their turn 5. The game ends when both players pass their turn in succession with no tiles remaining in the pool  SCORING The score for a turn is the sum of each digit in the equations formed or extended during that turn, according to the following rules: 1. Operator and equal sign tiles have no score value but do help capture bonus tiles.  2. The value of two consecutive number tiles is the sum of their individual values. So a 1 and 2 tile placed beside each other has a value of 3, not 12 3.

More dialogs will be written in part of effort to more complete game experience!  @Tony Peniyoung I was going to answer your concern but didnt really get the message!  @Grievlocke Wow, having big battle animations will be really cool. Number 1 in my wish list too. Simply there was no budget and it looks like there will be no budget in the future, either- looking at the sales.  @Many who wanted more stages I had random map generation for more guild quests, but I couldnt get the quality right yet. Random really never worked with the element of strategy, and became just a brute fighting. Partia 2 was planned for 25 stages that wraps up the story, but at 600 games sold, well, I wonder if I could ever get enough budget.  @ErnieBernie876 I know it is not as convenient as having a restart button, but you could suspend the game and load the last save data to restart the stage from the beginning.  @frozencracker It would be a bug if you have an attack option without having a valid target, but I cant seem to reproduce it. To cancel the attack while targeting, you could press B button (thats the inside button) or you could choose a target then select No.  I will try my best to answer any question!

The goal is to start colonies in all the spots available on the map and conquer all other civilizations towns. To start a new colony in an empty town spot you select one or more of your own towns and then an empty town spot. You select a town by tapping on it. You deselect a town by tapping it again.   Manage your resources! Build more houses to increase your towns population. As you have more and more peasants, you can mine for more gold that you use to build more houses, barracks and fortify your towns.  Barracks increase your soldiers numbers. This is where peasants train to become soldiers. Each town starts with a barracks and you can build an additional one to train more soldiers.  Fortify your town to resist attacks. A wall will surround your whole town. Walls can decimate an army before it comes into town, saving your peoples lives.  Be careful not to let your towns with to few soldiers and peasants or your colony might be taken over by another empire.   You win when the colonization process ended and you occupied all the towns on the map.   Play with Vikings, Romans, Mongols and Maya.   Colonies 2 has 30 different maps playable with each empire. The first 6 maps are free, the rest are unlocked by purchasing the full version of the game.   As you progress in your campaign the maps become more and more difficult.

New challenges added via the cloud and player rivalries will keep this game on the home screen of your iOS device.   From Ed Anderson, the creator of ZDAY Survival Simulator, Survivor Z is a text-based Role Playing Game set 311 days after the ZDAY apocalypse has wiped out 90% of the world\\s population.  Gameplay begins with an exciting strategy-based prologue, where the player has to make it home to the safety of their ZDAY bunker.  Then, fast forward almost a year, running low on food and water, our survivor is forced to emerge, only to find that the world has changed.  The population is decimated, and the dead roam the earth in incredible numbers.  Every decision a survivor makes can be the difference between life and death, and even the most seemingly trivial mistake can mean doom.  Excellent Player resources and help from the developers can be found on player forums:  http://forums.mongadillo.com  Gameplay in Survivor Z expands on the concept of its predecessor, ZDAY Survival Simulator.  While relying on the familiar text based model, Survivor Z introduces a vastly improved and incredibly robust game engine that gives the survivor complete control over their weapons, inventory, and armor.  In addition, players can use their items in context to complete challenges, as well as find an ally with non-player character survivors in the game.     Survivor Z is the first game of its kind, combining the intellectual challenge of a text based RPG with the fast paced action of a board game.  But Survivor Z doesn\\t stop there, in addition to being a very entertaining adventure game, Survivor Z adds another dimension by utilizing cloud based game content that will continually provide survivors with new updates and challenges, and uses location based services to transform the landscape around the survivor into the post apocalyptic world of Survivor Z.  Survivors will find real world location challenges like the Newark Cinema in Delaware, Restaurants in Portland, Oregon, and even the Buddy Holly museum in Lubbock Texas to name just a few, as well as hundreds of other challenges that can be found in any town in the country.  Everyday coffee shops, fast food restaurants, hardware stores and malls are all transformed to become the backdrops for survivor strongholds, hidden troves of weapons and supplies, and dangerous traps set by rival survivors.  No matter where you go when you are playing Survivor Z, you are in the realm of the undead, and no place is safe.    Once the player has fought through the fictional game content, the real work begins.  The player can search real world locations to find new challenges, unlock new stories, and try and build strongholds to protect against attacks from the undead and rival survivors.  Players fight to take and hold onto territory and resources as they struggle to survive.  The more your influence grows, the more powerful you will become.  Scavenge for supplies, craft fortifications and traps to protect your interests.  It you against the world.    **Note: This game requires an internet connection to play, and location services to be enabled.', Developer: 'Mongadillo Studios Inc.', Age_Rating: '12+', Size: 57778176, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aaiy-yoww-gold/id578857797', Name: 'Aaiy Yoww Gold', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/97/43/30/9743304f-b183-b53f-8b20-69e8691a9e7a/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Aaiy Yoww Gold takes up the crusade of the Alldotians with a vengeance.

Who says that computer programming should only be left to the adults?... although Cato\\u2019s Hike is geared towards children, it can definitely unlock the little programmer in all of us. -- AppAdvice   Even though this is the Lite version, it includes the tutorial world and the *FULL* map editor and sandbox so you can create your own little worlds and puzzles and play through them and challenge your friends and family around you.  The full version of the game will unlock the rest of the worlds and allow you to email and share your programs and maps as well as open maps and programs that your friends and family send you so you can teach and learn from them as well!  Cato is a little boy who just like every little boy likes to go out and play. One fine day Cato was playing outside when a portal to another world opened up in front of him; a portal to another world!   Cato stepped through and discovered that this world unlike his own didn\\t follow the same rules. Every time he tried to take a step or an action he\\d find himself stuck in place. Stuck that is until he finally discovered the rules in this universe: by writing a program for himself he would be able to overcome all obstacles and learn something new along the way!   Features:  * Simple programming interface using beautiful cards with pictures  * 59 levels and 10 tutorials (always working to add more!)  * Powerful map editor so you can create your own maps and puzzles and share with friends  * Preview your maps directly in the map editor to save time and test out your maps more quickly!  * Saves program progress so you can pick up at any time and iteratively develop  * Email your puzzle solutions to share your genius with others  * Beautiful artwork and amusing sound effects and music  * A manual to help guide parents and more interested users  * Puzzles ranging from easy to hard to teach different programming concepts without trying to force them  * Loops, branches and if/else, and simple memory using colored flags are the main tools used to introduce programming  * Emailed maps include gorgeous screenshot of what you are sending so your friends know what to expect  * Cato\\s Hike teaches children (ages 5+) the essentials of programming and how to think about solving complex problems  * The challenges in there are solvable easily by children of all ages but more nuanced and complex solutions should challenge teenagers and parents alike!  * Just a fun puzzle game :)   Upcoming features:  * MORE LEVELS!  * Hints on harder levels  * Possibly more tutorial levels if enough ask for it  * Possible cloud-sync   Essentially, \\Cato\\u2019s Hike\\ is a universal game for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch to teach kids and young children basic programming skills. The younger ones will obviously enjoy solving levels using simpler coding techniques but the hope is the older ones will pick up more advanced concepts like loops and branching as well as even more advanced concepts like a basic stack or memory! There is enough in here to keep everyone from children to parents engaged! More challenges are upcoming however so stay tuned!   As with all my projects I take this one very seriously and I hope you enjoy. I intend to continue improving Cato\\s Hike as much as possible and incorporate your feedback and suggestions as well as try to make it more intuitive and better able to convey the concepts it is setting out to teach.

The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.  To do that, you\\u2019ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?

Fighters are equipped with missiles that chase the enemy. Achieve a target, aim, shoot and observe how they fall wrapped in flames! Fighters also have machine guns for close combat, many times they are better than missiles. When you see a missile heading towards you, make a quick turn to avoid it.  Some helicopters are equipped with missiles and machine guns, others only with missiles. Jeeps are equipped with machine guns. Antiaircrafts are equipped with smart missiles.  In many missions you can handle several units at once, coordinating them to destroy the enemy.  At any time you can visualize the battle from above. This has two functions: 1. Select units and send them to any point on the map, handling the battle as a general. 2. Select the unit you want to handle in the first person.  This system is something that very few games have and gives you total control of the battle.  In some missions there are manufacturing of airplanes, helicopters and jeeps, you will have to occupy the enemy bases to destroy them all.

HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK...   Create a plan of attack to push your opponent\\u2019s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you\\u2019re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent\\u2019s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There\\u2019s no use in rushing; it\\u2019s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers.   ...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE.  If you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it\\u2019s better to be patient if you want to win!   DON\\u2019T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE   The keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent\\u2019s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher.

Played with a pack of 40 mega trump cards, the aim of the game is to trump your opponent and take all his cards. Compare cards in a race to collect all your opponents super trump cars.  The Classic Car cards have six categories, compete against your opponent by selecting the best category from the following: TOP SPEED, COOLNESS, 0-60 TIME, CAPACITY, POWER, WEIGHT. The weight category wins when it is the lightest, acceleration wins when it is fastest, all other categories win when they are the highest value.  The player with the winning value for the category selected wins the 2 cards and  places them at the bottom off their pile of cards. In the event of a draw both the  cards of the player and opponent are added into the draw pot. The winner of the next  round wins all of the cards in the draw pot as well as the top card from each player.  The aim of the game is to win all of your opponents cards.  The following games are available to play:  One Player - The player enters the paddock and races against the iPhone/iPod.  Two Player - Two people play via bluetooth. The game must be installed on both devices. The winner must trump their opponent and take all the other players cards to win. Follow the on screen instructions to connect.  Points Game - The Player plays against the computer and is awarded points for winning dependent on the category selected. The higher the chance of winning the lower the points. To get a high score you must risk gambling on a category with a small chance of winning. Try playing for a draw as both players points are added into a draw pot, whoever wins the next hand is awarded all the points in the draw pot. Winning 5 consecutive hands will result in the available points being doubled. Losing a hand will return all points values back to their original values. Watch out for the cheat, that shows you the winning category. Shaking your phone will swap the current card only 3 shakes are available!.

In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!   === Description === MechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It\\u2019s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune. It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.  === How To Play === Gameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!    You left in charge of Papa Louie\\s famous Burgeria, where you\\ll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you\\ll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station\\s bin slider for even better precision when building.  Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you\\ll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa\\s Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren\\t available in previous versions!  **NEW FOR PAPA\\S BURGERIA TO GO**  Papa\\s Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won\\t get in the way of the action!

Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.  GRILL STATION - We\\ve made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you\\ll get an alert when it\\s time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!  BUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we\\ve completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You\\ll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you\\ve cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!   **GAME FEATURES**  - Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe - All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens - Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving - Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips - Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders - Challenging Closers and Food Critic - Over 50 in-game achievements to earn  **NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**  Papa\\s Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

In this over-the-top satire youre tasked with building your own pipeline, and trying to balance the financial demands of using the least pipe to make the most money against the impact on the local environment and neighbouring farms.   On the right, a gas company rep keeps track of your budget and continually pushes you to create the most direct economical route - every piece of pipe costs money and every second counts.  Meanwhile, on the left a local farmer gauges your impact on the area and community.  Lay your pipe too close to the pastures and risk springing a leak that kills livestock or makes people sick.  Build through forest or near water and  incite protesters that block your path.  Suffer a leak or raise local indignation too far and risk potential pipe sabotage that could end your operation.   PIPE TROUBLE is a Pop Sandbox Production, produced in collaboration with Six Island Productions with the support of the Ontario Media Development Corporation and the Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund. It was developed with the support of docSHIFT (an initiative of the Documentary Organization of Canadas Toronto chapter).  NOW WITH UNIVERSAL DEVICE SUPPORT!

It had been a long time since the last war between Terran and Orcs. The descendants of the Elements Masters had built their own kingdoms.  Time passed by, the elemental force of fire had become more and more powerful, and the fire lord was no longer satisfied with his territory... Once again, war broke out. The fire lord was blinded by his greed. He made a deal with devil to obtain power from the hell. Then, he summoned monsters from hell and made them invulnerable with dark magic... When the fire lord had seemed to seize the absolute advantage, the other two tribes discovered an extraordinary energy fluctuation. They followed it and found another ancient tribe, the WIND! Heroes, the World of Elements need you now!  In this myth-style Defense / TD game, you will see troops of undead, monsters and Orcs.

For hundreds of years, under the wings of the king and his knights, the people enjoyed times without war. One day, the serenity is shattered, for an evil warlock treads on these lands, bringing with him countless demons and orcs as he watches from his foreboding tower. King Fred Kelsen and his powerful army must clash against this legion, leaving Prince Randhir Kelsen and the kingdom in the hands of his brother - the erudite and famed Regent, Sage Marcus Kelsen.  Alas, the plot thickens. With Regent Marcus in power, his true color emerges; wresting the nations authority, consorting with demons, and eradicating the only obstacle to the throne - Prince Randhir.  Protected by his loyal guard, the prince flees the castle. He must ride to the borders, rally his own band of mercenaries, and embark on the path of vengeance.  \\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606\\u2605\\u2606 Our twitter: https://twitter.com/itiangua  Like us: http://www.facebook.com/iTIANGUA  Our website: http://www.itiangua.com/  E-mail: service@itiangua.com', Developer: 'TIANGUA Co.,Ltd', Age_Rating: '9+', Size: 62155652, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tic-tac-toe-glow/id610277867', Name: 'Tic Tac Toe Glow', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/e1/1e/1d/e11e1d7f-69bd-3ffd-5080-c0717b442474/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Play Tic Tac Toe Glow!.
