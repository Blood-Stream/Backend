Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \\u2013 either online or against the AI.\\n\\nGalactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time.

The rich camel hears him, meets him and finds out they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy, by Fortune and Fate, in the course of seven amazing voyages... \\n \\nThe First Voyage - Sinbad sets to sea to find a fortune. After finding a lot of diamonds on different islands during his first voyage, he lands on an island that  proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale. After being awaken, the whale pulls Sinbad into the water.  Sinbad struggles to keep afloat and needs your help.  HINT: To help Sinbad come back safely home find the harpoon to  stay on whales back! \\n \\nThe Second Voyage - Sinbad is restless and sets to the sea again. He leaves his ship and finds himself stranded in an deep island valley populated by birds called Rocs and their just hatched eggs. The valley is also full of diamonds.   Merchants harvest these diamonds by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley which rolls down the steep  walls, picking up the diamonds as they roll to the bottom.  The Rocs pickup the meat rolled in diamonds and bring it back to their nests to feed their young.. Sinbad wants to use this to get out of the valley.  HINT: To help Sinbad become rescued, find a chunk of meat to strap on his back and get carried to the nest!\\n \\nThe Third Voyage - Adventure calls and Sinbad sets to sea for a third time. He finds himself on the island and captured by a huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of color, ...  He needs a weapon to free himself from the creature.  HINT: To help Sinbad escape, find a sword to blind the creature with!\\n \\nThe Fourth Voyage - Sinbad sets sails again. He finds himself trapped in an underground cavern of one of the islands. He needs your help to escape.  HINT: Find a map to help Sinbad find a way out of the cavern!\\n \\nThe Fifth Voyage - Seized with the longing to travel, Sinbad starts his fifth journey. In this adventure, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad\\s neck and will not let go. The only way to free Sinbad is to distract the Old Man of the Sea.  HINT: Find a wine goblets to help Sinbad trick  the Old Man into drinking some and escape!\\n \\nThe Sixth Voyage - Yearning for another travel, Sinbad, on his sixth voyage, finds himself cast on a desolate river shore. In order to escape this desolate shore, Sinbad must leave the shore via raft.  HINT: Find a knife to help Sinbad construct a raft and float down the river to the nearest city.\\n \\nThe Seventh Voyage - The sea calls to Sinbad and he answers one more time. This time he gets set down on a mountain-top by bird-people existing on one of the islands. The only way off the mountain top is to scale down its steep cliffs.  HINT: To get Sinbad safely home find a rope to get him down of the mountain.\\n\\n*** Features***\\n\\nAmazing 3D graphics and 7 levels of play.\\n3 different power ups: SKATEBOARD - to speed up Sinbad, HOURGLASS - to add time to finish the voyage and KEY to help you unlock parts of the maze if you can\\t find way out.\\nRandomly generated maps, so each game is never the same.\\nMultiplayer game mode for iPhone and iPad that allows you to play against people all over the world.\\nUniversal game, works on iPhone, iPod and iPad.\\n\\n*** Transport yourself in the world of Sinbad, BECOME THE VOYAGER, download now! ***","Developer":"Excel Heritage Group, Inc.","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":19804535,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/street-food-tycoon-chef-fever-world-cook-ing-star/id498812738","Name":"Street-food Tycoon Chef Fever: World Cook-ing Star","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/56/4c/0f/564c0f54-2f5e-5fd6-47b7-e68d39b7cf03/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"WARNING: Very addictive Tycoon game!

THE ULTIMATE IPAD STRATEGY GAME : GENESIA LITE !\\n\\nThis new version of GENESIA is inspired from the game of the same name I created twenty years ago on Amiga 500.

Contrary to \\xab Gameplay \\xbb where everything is pre-cooked and where your hand is being held to redirect you every two minutes, here there is no tutorial obligating you to do this or that in order to advance. \\n\\nIn GENESIA, there are no mind blowing special effects. I preferred to keep my focus on the deepness and interest of the game. \\n\\nAN \\xab OLD FASHIONED \\xbb GAME, WITH REAL \\xab TURN BASED \\xbb BITS IN THEM ! \\n\\nOne year is divided into four seasons and each season corresponds to one round in the game. In the beginning of each round, little time is given to you to elaborate your strategies and distribute your orders, before passing to your opponent\\u2019s hand. \\n\\nYou can do what you want at any given moment whenever you feel the need to. Being quick or slow isn\\u2019t a problem, at any given moment the situations can permute and a well played hand can change the unravelling of the round. A situation that seems completely hopeless to you can, armed with patience and strategy, turn around to your favor. \\n\\nTACTICAL COMBAT, MANAGEMENT, ADVENTURE AND \\xab GEMS \\xbb ! \\n\\nGENESIA isn\\u2019t a simple race against time. You will always have several ways to do what must be done, and step by step, you will sharpen your tactics. To achieve victory, you will have to develop your economy\\u2019s politics and accumulate resources that will enable you to recruit soldiers to find as fast as you can gems of NEORT. \\n\\nGENESIA \\xab IT\\u2019S ALIVE \\xbb ! \\n\\nTo evolve in GENESIA, you will have to act as harmoniously as possible. Several crafts are at your disposal to build this New World : farmers, lumberjacks, blacksmiths, carpenters, soldiers... But all of this won\\u2019t be done easily for other Governors are striving just as you, on other territories. It\\u2019s your economy\\u2019s development, your military force and technological advancement that will lead you to the term of your engagement. \\n\\nAs in every society, your people aspire to happiness and have their own lives.

As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package.\\nHearts is trick-taking playing card game for 4 players, no teams and no trump suit. The game is also known as The Dirty, Black Lady, Chase the Lady, Crubs, and Black Maria, though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is regarded as a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game. The object of the game is to avoid taking points. When the first player reaches 100 points, the player with the lowest number of points is the winner.\\n\\nIn hearts each heart card is worth 1 point and the queen of spades is worth 13 points, which is as much as all of the other cards combined.\\nAt the beginning of round, the players choose three cards to pass to a random player. The player with the 2 of clubs must lead the first trick with the 2 of clubs. For each trick a player must follow suit unless he does not have a card of that suit. Because there is no trump, a player can not win a trick if he passes a card of any suit other than the suit lead. Hearts can not be lead until hearts are broken - after the first heart card has been played. If a player takes every point in a round, he \\u201cShoots the Moon\\u201d and he receives 0 points for the round while all other players receive 26 points.\\n\\nDont forget to check our Games section for more fun games...","Developer":"GASP Mobile Games Inc","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":10183680,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/witty/id508654878","Name":"Witty","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/21/2f/7c/212f7c81-8382-5369-7760-b1a34ff36a3b/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"One of the Lakoo cats.

The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for beginner to intermediate. The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.\\n\\nThe rules of the game is simple:\\n- You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called pyramid or turtle solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others. \\n- To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them.\\n- Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked. \\nA tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\\s no tiles above it.\\n- You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\\s no more tiles that can be moved.\\n\\nSounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\\ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked. \\n\\nAs mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not free, which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\\t be moved because there\\s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you\e matching pictures of painted Easter eggs.\\n- Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike.\\n- The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included. \\n- Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it.\\n- Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\\s a match possible).\\n- Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will free some of the previously blocked tiles. But use sparingly because the number of Shuffles is limited.\\n- Cheerful graphics and soothing background music.\\n- Every board (level) is generated with a special algorithm. No game is ever the same; and even though your moves may make a board unsolvable, every board starts with a solvable configuration.\\n\\nWorks on phone and tablets.

Black has the top row, bottom row goal areas; and White has the left column and right column goal areas.   The first player who can establish a network linking its two goal areas wins the game.  A network is a series of six of more pieces that starts from one goal areas and ends in the other.  Each consecutive pair of pieces in the series are joined to each other along either horizontal, vertical or diagonal straight paths.  \\nAn opponents piece placed in any cell on the path between the two pieces breaks the path.  Although more than one piece may be placed in a goal area, a network can only be made with a starting piece in one goal area and an ending piece in the other goal area.  A network cannot utilize pieces from the same goal area.   A network cannot go through a piece more than once. \\n\\nA network cannot go through a piece without turning. Paths that has no change in direction cannot be part of the network .\\nThe players alternate taking turns, with White moving first.  Rules of legal play are:\\n- The four corners are not played\\n- Cannot place a piece into a cell that is already taken\\n- The opponents goal areas are off-limits\\n- Cannot place a piece into a cell that would result in three or more of its own color pieces form adjacent cluster.   A group of three pieces form a cluster if one of them is adjacent (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) to the other two.\\nEach player takes turns to place the pieces on the board.  If neither player has won when all 20 pieces are on the board, each play takes turn to move a piece to another cell, subject to the same restrictions.   A player must make a move to a different cell.  Lifting a piece may unblock a connection between opponent pieces.  If after the piece is placed at the new location, it breaks the network at some other point, the opponent does not win.  However, if the move completes a network for the opponent, the player making the move loses, even if that move causes both players to complete the network.\\n\\nClick on the Info button in the game will display the above documentation. \\n\\nThere is also a demo mode that demonstrates the game play.\\n\\nThe practice mode, available for single and double player games, is another good way to learn the game.

We have replaced libraries with tombs; you will always find money in tombs, and your hero will never die searching tombs. No diplomacy available, but we will implement it.

So, any time they notice that there is a crowd -- a crowd is 4 or more like clones living next to each other --  the other tenants pay you to evict them. \\n\\nA smart building manager, you have learned three things about your tenants. First, they are rich; so they are always able and willing to pay to evict crowds. Second they are lazy; whenever there is space below them in the building, they move down. (The building does not have an elevator.) Finally,  they are stupid; they only move down vertically and they move down regardless of whether moving puts them in a crowd. So, by cleverly evicting tenants, you can create situations to make more money for yourself. \\n\\nThe building can have from 1 to 4 managers. When there is more than one manager, you can either compete with the other managers for eviction money or you can cooperate with the other managers to maximized the money earned. Any or all of the managers can be automated.

It was invented by the ancient Hawaiian Polynesians. The game begins with all the counters laid out on the board in an alternating pattern of black and white. Players then hop over one anothers pieces capturing them similar to checkers. The first player who can no longer make a capture is the loser, and the other player is the winner.\\nIn ancient times, the pieces used were black and white lava stones played over a large rock which doubled as a board and table.\\nThe game appears somewhat similar to draughts. Pieces hop over one another when capturing. However, the similarities end there. In draughts, one players pieces are initially set up on one side of the board opposite the other players pieces. In Konane, both players pieces are intermixed in an alternating pattern of black and white that covers the whole board. Furthermore, in Konane all moves are capturing moves, and they are done in an orthogonal direction (not diagonally).","Developer":"POK","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":3342336,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/war-room/id541409129","Name":"War Room","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/f9/1a/fd/f91afde1-d18e-dd34-9c43-b6e6ecf0e408/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"A Message From Privateer:\\n\\nWith the announcement of the new editions for WARMACHINE and HORDES, we have disabled Mk II faction deck and bundle purchases in War Room.

Rack the balls with a powerful break shot. Impress your friends your billiard playing skill! You don\\u2019t have to buy an expensive pool table just to enjoy fun and addictive pool party with your friends. Just download our app and play for FREE! \\n\\nDo you love to play billiard? Have you ever dreamed of becoming a biliard or snooker master, playing bilyard on a pool live tour across the country? Maybe you even dream of participating in the World Pool Championship. To become a maestro, you must practice and play against tough opponents to sharpen your snooker skill. The problem is, like most people, you probably don\\u2019t have access to a pool table 24/7.  However, you can still practice your skills by playing virtual 8ball pool on your iOS device. You can practice with your friends or random players who also enjoy playing snoker as much as you do. \\n\\nSome people like to play 9 ball pool and some people enjoy 8ball pool games. In Pool with Friends, the game you can play is the 8 ball pool version. The rule of the game is slightly different than the 9 ball version. For example, in the 8ball version, you may not put the opponent\\u2019s balls into the pockets. By playing this game, you will be able to practice and learn about the rules of the game easily. \\n\\n=============================================================\\nTOP FEATURES OF POOL WITH FRIENDS \\u2013 EIGHT BALL POOL MULTIPLAYER: \\n=============================================================\\n\\n#MULTIPLAYER BILLIARD GAME\\n\\nPlay with your friends offline or play with random players online.  You can also play against yourself to practice your shots.   \\n\\n#REALISTIC 3D SIMULATOR\\n\\nPool with Friends uses an advanced and realistic physic simulator. You will see how the balls move on the pool table when you hit the ball with different strength and direction. Enjoy playing as if you are pool billiards pro.   \\n\\n#BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC GRAPHIC\\n\\nWe handcrafted the game graphic to make it look realistic and sharp. The graphic will help you determine how to make the best and most accurate shot. \\n\\n#LEARN ABOUT THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE PLAYING\\n\\nAfter your turn, we will check the table and inform you if you\\u2019ve committed a foul. We will also inform you the name of the foul. For example Scratch is a foul when a player pockets the white ball. As the result, the opponent can choose where to place the white ball.

It is interesting mostly because it was coded entirely on an iPad in Lua using the Codea application from Two Lives Left.\\n\\nThe sprites in the game were drawn using Spritely, the sprite editor which comes with Codea.\\n\\nThe source code for this game and a description of how it was built is available for download at the Codea Tutorial site (http://codeatuts.blogspot.com.au/)\\n\\nOBJECTIVE:\\n\\nThe objective of the game is to clear the grid without tapping any of the mines. If you tap a mine the game is over.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\n\\nFrom the menu you can select Easy, Medium or Hard games. The difference in difficulty is determined by the size of the game grid and the number of mines.\\n\\nEasy - grid dimensions 8x8 with 8 mines\\nMedium - grid dimensions 15x15 with 30 mines\\nHard - grid dimension 18x18 with 60 mines\\n\\nThe game screen shows the number of cells not cleared in the top left hand corner and game duration on the right. Tapping on the game grid will reveal either an empty square or a mine.\\n\\nThe first tap is a gamble. In this version of Minesweeper it is possible for your first tap to be on a mine. Mines are placed randomly in different positions each game. If there are no mines surrounding the cell you tap then all of these cells will also be revealed at the same time. If there is a number in a revealed cell this indicates the number of mines in the surrounding cells. You can use this information to deduce the location of the mines.\\n\\nMathematically it has been shown that the highest chance of clearing multiple cells is by tapping in a corner.\\n\\nThere are three buttons on the game screen:\\n\\nShow/Flag: Tapping the shovel or flag icon at the bottom of the screen will toggle between show and flag mode. In show mode, tapping a cell will reveal it. In flag mode, tapping a cell will place a flag on it, indicating there may be a mine underneath. You dont have to use flags but they make the game easier to solve.\\n\\nNew: Will reset the grid and start a new game.\\n\\nMenu: If tapped will take you back to the Menu screen.\\n\\nHIGHSCORE:\\n\\nThe high score for each of the three game difficulties is stored. You get a high score by solving the grid in the shortest recorded time.","Developer":"Reefwing Software","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":6858752,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheres-my-penny-free/id554788226","Name":"Wheres My Penny?

The clues are shown - a pair of elements and a sign between them. The clue tells how the two elements are located in the table relative to each other. Clues are of several types, for example:\\n\\nLeft - indicated by an arrow pointing to the left, and means that the column of the first clue element is located in the table directly to the left of the column of the second element;\\n\\nNeighbors - indicated by a double-headed arrow, and means that the clue elements are in the adjacent columns of the game table, but which one is on the left, and which on the right is unknown;\\n\\nIn one column is indicated by an equal sign, and means that the clue elements are strictly in any one column of the game table;\\n\\nIn a specific column is also denoted by an equal sign, but the second clue element is the number of the column in which the first clue element is located.\\n\\nDespite the unusual shape, the Genius Brain can be considered an ordinary classic puzzle when parts of an image need to be put together. Each clue in the Genius Brain is one of these parts. Therefore, the player\\u2019s goal is to place all clues in an empty (imaginary) table at the same time. After that, the only possible column of the table will be found, in which the element indicated at the bottom of the playing field can be located. This number must be entered at the bottom of the playing field. And it\\s all. If you are not mistaken, you have solved the problem.\\n\\nSolving the first tasks in the mind can be a serious challenge. Therefore, I recommend using a pencil and paper at the initial stage. But as soon as you get comfortable, I highly recommend solving problems in your mind. It is then that the Genius Brain will reveal its powerful training potential.

Our original attempt at an app for this game was unfortunately less-than-stellar (to be kind). We knew we could do better, and we committed to making it better. Regrettably, it took us a long time - and three different developers - to finally create this new version. But at last we have an app that we are REALLY proud of. We hope you guys will like it, too, and find it a major improvement over the original game.\\n\\nThis new app update is an entirely new game with 100% new code, so you guys are getting a completely different app from the original. We are providing it as an \\u201cupdated version\\u201d because that was the only way I could figure out to make sure that the owners of the original could get the new app for free. Please accept this as our apology that the original app wasn\\u2019t better, for the time it took us to get you the new version, and as a demonstration of our determination to never leave you stuck with a game that isn\\u2019t a quality product.\\n\\nFor you players who already play the Dominant Species boardgame, this app will allow you to have fun and practice your skills anytime, against a mix of human and computer AI opponents.  \\n\\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with the boardgame, we provide context-sensitive explanations and a set of online rules to help you learn the game and get started quickly. You can also get help from us directly, via our Facebook page - which we are revamping to support the new version - at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dominant-Species-for-iPad/320893411343198. If you want to learn more strategy or have questions about general game play (not app-related), feel free to ask your questions on our Dominant Species page on BoardgameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62219/dominant-species\\n\\nHeres an updated feature list. Note that we are working on an additional update which will add multi-player Game Center support.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\nPlay against a mix of up to 5 human and/or AI opponents via Solo Play, Pass N Play,  or a combination of both.\\nA completely reworked User Interface that makes the game much easier to play\\nNew Pull-Out visual menus that provide quick access to Tile Scoring, Speciation Values, Food Chain, and Dominance Cards.\\nAll New Art from the new version of the boardgames\\nAI players that are greatly improved from the original version.\\nA new Undo feature\\nAutosave and Resume Game\\nPinch to zoom and scroll\\nContext-sensitive help\\nColor-coded dominance tracking\\n\\n\\nFinally, I want to personally thank all the great folks at GameTheory, who rewrote the entire app and gave us a product to be proud of. I also want to thank the people who volunteered to help us test Dominant Species, caught many bugs, and gave us great suggestions throughout. You guys did terrific work - thanks!\\n\\nOK, enough talk. It\\u2019s time to play.

The fog will last for around 10 seconds.\\n\\nRight then, you think: you could just wait for the fog to disappear?\\n\\nNot exactly: in NORMAL mode, your item gets automatically fired after 6 or 7 seconds, so you have to use your visual memory to fire these before they land in some possibly inconvenient place.\\n\\nNow about the HARD mode.\\n\\nIt is HARD.\\n\\nWhenever hitting a blocker, not only will you get some fog to bother you, but the blockers direct neighbors will randomly change color.\\nAh... and the Auto-Fire delay is reduced by half: both of these particularities will force you to use your reflexes and capacities to readjust your strategy continually to eventually win (which might not occur frequently).\\n\\nBecause the game can be fairly to awfully hard, you might want to publish your score on its leaderboards.

Tiles must be placed according to the following rules:\\n1.  Each turn must use at least 1 tile from the board and 2 tiles from your hand\\n2.  All adjacent tiles must be part of a true and complete equation\\n3.  Tiles cannot be moved once they are played\\n4.  Players may choose to pass and forfeit their turn\\n5. The game ends when both players pass their turn in succession with no tiles remaining in the pool\\n\\nSCORING\\nThe score for a turn is the sum of each digit in the equations formed or extended during that turn, according to the following rules:\\n1.

New challenges added via the cloud and player rivalries will keep this game on the home screen of your iOS device. \\n\\nFrom Ed Anderson, the creator of ZDAY Survival Simulator, Survivor Z is a text-based Role Playing Game set 311 days after the ZDAY apocalypse has wiped out 90% of the world\\s population.  Gameplay begins with an exciting strategy-based prologue, where the player has to make it home to the safety of their ZDAY bunker.  Then, fast forward almost a year, running low on food and water, our survivor is forced to emerge, only to find that the world has changed.  The population is decimated, and the dead roam the earth in incredible numbers.  Every decision a survivor makes can be the difference between life and death, and even the most seemingly trivial mistake can mean doom.\\n\\nExcellent Player resources and help from the developers can be found on player forums:  http://forums.mongadillo.com\\n\\nGameplay in Survivor Z expands on the concept of its predecessor, ZDAY Survival Simulator.  While relying on the familiar text based model, Survivor Z introduces a vastly improved and incredibly robust game engine that gives the survivor complete control over their weapons, inventory, and armor.  In addition, players can use their items in context to complete challenges, as well as find an ally with non-player character survivors in the game.   \\n\\nSurvivor Z is the first game of its kind, combining the intellectual challenge of a text based RPG with the fast paced action of a board game.  But Survivor Z doesn\\t stop there, in addition to being a very entertaining adventure game, Survivor Z adds another dimension by utilizing cloud based game content that will continually provide survivors with new updates and challenges, and uses location based services to transform the landscape around the survivor into the post apocalyptic world of Survivor Z.\\n\\nSurvivors will find real world location challenges like the Newark Cinema in Delaware, Restaurants in Portland, Oregon, and even the Buddy Holly museum in Lubbock Texas to name just a few, as well as hundreds of other challenges that can be found in any town in the country.  Everyday coffee shops, fast food restaurants, hardware stores and malls are all transformed to become the backdrops for survivor strongholds, hidden troves of weapons and supplies, and dangerous traps set by rival survivors.  No matter where you go when you are playing Survivor Z, you are in the realm of the undead, and no place is safe.  \\n\\nOnce the player has fought through the fictional game content, the real work begins.  The player can search real world locations to find new challenges, unlock new stories, and try and build strongholds to protect against attacks from the undead and rival survivors.  Players fight to take and hold onto territory and resources as they struggle to survive.  The more your influence grows, the more powerful you will become.  Scavenge for supplies, craft fortifications and traps to protect your interests.  It you against the world.  \\n\\n**Note: This game requires an internet connection to play, and location services to be enabled.","Developer":"Mongadillo Studios Inc.","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":57778176,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aaiy-yoww-gold/id578857797","Name":"Aaiy Yoww Gold","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/97/43/30/9743304f-b183-b53f-8b20-69e8691a9e7a/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Aaiy Yoww Gold takes up the crusade of the Alldotians with a vengeance.

The full version of the game will unlock the rest of the worlds and allow you to email and share your programs and maps as well as open maps and programs that your friends and family send you so you can teach and learn from them as well!\\n\\nCato is a little boy who just like every little boy likes to go out and play. One fine day Cato was playing outside when a portal to another world opened up in front of him; a portal to another world! \\n\\nCato stepped through and discovered that this world unlike his own didn\\t follow the same rules. Every time he tried to take a step or an action he\\d find himself stuck in place. Stuck that is until he finally discovered the rules in this universe: by writing a program for himself he would be able to overcome all obstacles and learn something new along the way! \\n\\nFeatures: \\n* Simple programming interface using beautiful cards with pictures \\n* 59 levels and 10 tutorials (always working to add more!) \\n* Powerful map editor so you can create your own maps and puzzles and share with friends \\n* Preview your maps directly in the map editor to save time and test out your maps more quickly! \\n* Saves program progress so you can pick up at any time and iteratively develop \\n* Email your puzzle solutions to share your genius with others \\n* Beautiful artwork and amusing sound effects and music \\n* A manual to help guide parents and more interested users \\n* Puzzles ranging from easy to hard to teach different programming concepts without trying to force them \\n* Loops, branches and if/else, and simple memory using colored flags are the main tools used to introduce programming \\n* Emailed maps include gorgeous screenshot of what you are sending so your friends know what to expect \\n* Cato\\s Hike teaches children (ages 5+) the essentials of programming and how to think about solving complex problems \\n* The challenges in there are solvable easily by children of all ages but more nuanced and complex solutions should challenge teenagers and parents alike! \\n* Just a fun puzzle game :) \\n\\nUpcoming features: \\n* MORE LEVELS! \\n* Hints on harder levels \\n* Possibly more tutorial levels if enough ask for it \\n* Possible cloud-sync \\n\\nEssentially, \\Cato\\u2019s Hike\\ is a universal game for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch to teach kids and young children basic programming skills. The younger ones will obviously enjoy solving levels using simpler coding techniques but the hope is the older ones will pick up more advanced concepts like loops and branching as well as even more advanced concepts like a basic stack or memory! There is enough in here to keep everyone from children to parents engaged! More challenges are upcoming however so stay tuned! \\n\\nAs with all my projects I take this one very seriously and I hope you enjoy. I intend to continue improving Cato\\s Hike as much as possible and incorporate your feedback and suggestions as well as try to make it more intuitive and better able to convey the concepts it is setting out to teach.

But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.\\n\\nTo do that, you\\u2019ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more.

Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles. The goal of this abstract board game is simple: push your opponent\\u2019s marbles off the board! But beware, it\\u2019s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! \\n\\nHAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK... \\n\\nCreate a plan of attack to push your opponent\\u2019s marbles off the board. On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles. When you\\u2019re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent\\u2019s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles. There\\u2019s no use in rushing; it\\u2019s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers. \\n\\n...AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE.\\n\\nIf you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves. Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent. The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it\\u2019s better to be patient if you want to win! \\n\\nDON\\u2019T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE \\n\\nThe keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent\\u2019s play. Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought. To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play. For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time. The challenges get harder as you advance. For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher.\\n \\nPLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS \\n\\nPlay alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends. With Pass & Play Mode, you can duel on the same device! Tired of playing your friends? Log in to your Asmodee.net account to face players from all around the world and make your way to the top through the new ranking!\\n \\nFeatures: \\n\\u2022 Solo:\\n- 3 levels of difficulty against the AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)\\n- A solo campaign with unique challenges\\n- A game mode that lets you create your own game, your own rules, and place the first marbles \\n\\u2022 Multiplayer: \\n- Pass & Play Mode\\n- Online Mode \\n\\nTo find more information about Asmodee Digital, please go to http://www.asmodee-digital.com\\n\\nHaving an issue?

Compare cards in a race to collect all your opponents super trump cars.\\n\\nThe Classic Car cards have six categories, compete against your opponent by selecting the best category from the following: TOP SPEED, COOLNESS, 0-60 TIME, CAPACITY, POWER, WEIGHT. The weight category wins when it is the lightest, acceleration wins when it is fastest, all other categories win when they are the highest value.\\n\\nThe player with the winning value for the category selected wins the 2 cards and \\nplaces them at the bottom off their pile of cards. In the event of a draw both the \\ncards of the player and opponent are added into the draw pot. The winner of the next \\nround wins all of the cards in the draw pot as well as the top card from each player. \\nThe aim of the game is to win all of your opponents cards.\\n\\nThe following games are available to play:\\n\\nOne Player - The player enters the paddock and races against the iPhone/iPod.\\n\\nTwo Player - Two people play via bluetooth. The game must be installed on both devices. The winner must trump their opponent and take all the other players cards to win. Follow the on screen instructions to connect.\\n\\nPoints Game - The Player plays against the computer and is awarded points for winning dependent on the category selected. The higher the chance of winning the lower the points. To get a high score you must risk gambling on a category with a small chance of winning. Try playing for a draw as both players points are added into a draw pot, whoever wins the next hand is awarded all the points in the draw pot. Winning 5 consecutive hands will result in the available points being doubled. Losing a hand will return all points values back to their original values.

In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!\\n \\n=== Description ===\\nMechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It\\u2019s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune. It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.\\n\\n=== How To Play ===\\nGameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example. Once you create your army, you can converge on the map to take control of Beacons where you can deploy more units. Capturing and keeping Beacons is vital in making your way across the map. Engage and eliminate all opponent units and structures to be declared the victor. \\n\\n=== Game Features ===\\n\\u2022  Basic Tutorial.\\n\\u2022  Challenging AI.\\n\\u2022  Simple 3D graphics.\\n\\u2022  7 Ranks to progress though.\\n\\u2022  Simple large touch controls.\\n\\u2022  12 maps set in 3 different landscapes.\\n\\u2022  NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES EVER!\\n\\u2022  Old-school resources collection system.\\n\\u2022  2 game modes (Ranked Game and Custom Game).\\n\\u2022  16 unique combinations of mechs PLUS UPGRADES!\\n\\n=== Game Tips ===\\n\\u2022  Strongest is not always best.\\n\\u2022  Upgrades and key to victory.\\n\\u2022  Hover chassis can go over water and works great for scouts.\\n\\u2022  Speed is important.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \\n\\nYou\e left in charge of Papa Louie\\s famous Burgeria, where you\\ll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\\n\\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you\\ll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station\\s bin slider for even better precision when building.\\n\\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you\\ll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa\\s Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren\\t available in previous versions!\\n\\n**NEW FOR PAPA\\S BURGERIA TO GO**\\n\\nPapa\\s Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won\\t get in the way of the action!\\n\\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You\\ll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\\n\\nGRILL STATION - We\\ve made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you\\ll get an alert when it\\s time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\\n\\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we\\ve completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You\\ll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you\\ve cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\\n\\n\\n**GAME FEATURES**\\n\\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\\n\\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\\n\\nPapa\\s Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Meanwhile, on the left a local farmer gauges your impact on the area and community.  Lay your pipe too close to the pastures and risk springing a leak that kills livestock or makes people sick.  Build through forest or near water and  incite protesters that block your path.  Suffer a leak or raise local indignation too far and risk potential pipe sabotage that could end your operation. \\n\\nPIPE TROUBLE is a Pop Sandbox Production, produced in collaboration with Six Island Productions with the support of the Ontario Media Development Corporation and the Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund.
