This classic puzzle has been expanded and reimagined into a unique and epic variation on an all-ages favorite!\\n\\nYOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY\\nBut you don\\u2019t!  TAC is played on a huge 3x3 grid called the Big Board.  Each of the nine squares are actually tic-tac-toe games of their own.

Players take turns placing either X\\u2019s or O\\u2019s in an effort to attain three in a row.\\n\\nTHE TWIST\\nEvery turn is a strategic dance.  Each placement you make on the Little Board determines which square your opponent gets to move to on the Big Board.  You can either gain advantage on the Little Board or force your opponent to play in a certain square.  Move wisely!\\n\\nSCORE\\nThere are two ways to win!  \\n1)  Score three in a row on the Big Board!  If you win on a little board, it\\u2019s like selecting a square on the big board.  If you succeed in lining up a trio of wins on the big board, you win!  \\n2)  Dominate the big board!  If you earn more squares on the big board than your opponent, you win!\\n\\nChallenge your Facebook buddies or square off against strangers.  Take on an AI opponent and perfect your strategy.

The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. \\n\\nThe American Revolution has begun! \\n\\nNow you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalists, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas. Players from each faction cooperate to gain control of key towns and forts. Share the fun in this light and fast paced game vs the AI, hotseat or online!\\n\\nKey Features \\n\\n1775: Rebellion features simple and unique game mechanics and special attention to historical detail. Experience this critical time in American history, you will not be disappointed! \\n\\n- 3 Scenarios \\u2013 1775, 1775 (Short) and Siege of Quebec. \\n- Play solo vs. 3 AI difficulties \\n- 54 Cards (Movement & Event) \\n- Cross-platform online play or up to 4 player hotseat multiplayer. \\n- Faithful conversion of the original board game.\\n\\nAbout the Game \\n\\n1775: Rebellion is based on the award winning board game developed by Academy Games. \\n\\nThe mapboard represents the original 13 Colonies plus Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony. Player controlled factions include the Continental Army, Patriot Militia, British Regulars and Loyalist Militia. In addition to this the Allied French and Allied Hessian factions, which are controlled by American and British forces respectively, can be brought into the game by event cards playable by each faction. \\n\\nEach game is played in a series of rounds. Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction. It is entirely possible for a faction to go last in a previous round only to go first in the next. \\n\\nMovement & Events \\n\\nEvery Faction has a deck of cards consisting of Event cards, Movement cards, and one Truce card. Every turn, each faction will play a movement card to maneuver their troops and any number of event cards. When both factions of a side (British or American) have played their truce cards, the game will end! Each deck has a specific number of movement cards in it and managing them is an important part of the game. \\n\\nEach faction has a Truce card which serves not only as a timer for the game but as a powerful Movement card. However, a game may end prematurely if both factions of a side are forced to play it early in the game.\\n\\nNote: We recommend playing on an iPhone 5S, iPad Mini 2, iPad Air, iPad Pro or newer device.","Developer":"HexWar Games Ltd","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":323195904,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/command-colours-the-great-war/id1004606061","Name":"Command & Colours: The Great War","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/3a/d4/d2/3ad4d2d1-e88b-184d-d7b8-555b85b544a4/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"HexWar Games has partnered with Plastic Soldier Company to bring you a digital version of Commands & Colors: The Great War board game.

Put on a uniform, fill up a gun and show them who is the boss.\\n \\nMice Invasion is an action game where you have to fight army of attacking mice trying to steal everything from your farm even your underwear. Your task is to prevent them doing so at any costs. In the role of a brave tomcat, you stand behind your loyal cannon and defend the farm. Dont be mistaken it seems like an easy task but its definitely not. There are lots of them and their muskets aim really precisely.\\n \\nThere are 45 levels full of action prepared for you. During these, you will meet four kinds of mouse attackers on three different battlefields. Gradually, you will be finding new kinds of ammunition for your loyal gun.\\n\\nBesides the level mode, you can play survival mode where you choose a battlefield and face the endless floods of enemies. If you are competitive you can measure your skill with your friends or other players in online score. Can you be the best?\\n \\nGame principle is easy. A cat with a gun is placed in the lower part of a screen, you move sideways with a gun by tilting a mobile device and shoot by tapping on the screen. Mice are going from the top of the screen, every now and then they stop, aim and shoot. Each received shot lowers cat\\u2019s determination to protect the farm as well as every mouse slipping through its barricade. When the determination reaches zero, game ends; but dont worry, you can try it again.\\n\\nOne last thing you will not manage with only shooting and dodging. The game is not about fast reflexes only. To successfully repulse all attacking waves it is necessary to use different kinds of ammunition and their bonuses correctly. SPOILER: focus on higher enemy ranks which provide individual waves with various bonuses; when they run away, a wave loses these bonuses.\\n\\nInformation about enemy soldiers, cannon ammunition and control is described in Help page in the game. \\n \\nIn a nutshell: \\n\\u2022\\t45 levels full of action\\n\\u2022\\t4 kinds of enemies\\n\\u2022\\t4 + 1 kinds of ammunition\\n\\u2022\\t3 different battlefields\\n\\u2022\\tSurvival mode with online rankings\\n\\u2022\\tChallenges (can you complete them all?) \\n\\u2022\\tAll this in a beautiful animated graphics inspired by the period of the Napoleonic Wars \\n \\nIf you like the game, you can buy additional uniform sets for the enemy soldiers as well as for the cat defender in the shop. You can buy cool ammunition, too. However, this ammunition is not necessary to finish the game (all levels can be completed without using it :)).\\n\\nDont wait, download now and enjoy :)","Developer":"Jakub Semrad","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":209170432,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zombwar/id1017224683","Name":"ZombWar","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/ac/e2/46/ace246a2-a85b-4a3c-db9e-c98936aea623/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Get ready to take control of your troops and battle the most whacky zombie invasion of all time!

Simple & challenging at the same time. \\n\\nYour goal is to conquer the world by capturing all the cities. Captured cities produce more units to your imperial army. Your can choose between tanks, transporters, planes and submarines which all have different roles in the War among Empires. \\n\\nWorld of Empires consists of small islands occupied by four nations competing with each other. Every nation starts with one city, but there are plenty of free cities to conquer before the War really starts. As the player you control the Blue nation and both units and cities are waiting for your orders. Tactical vision is required as only tanks have a good chance of liberating enemy cities, but at the same time there are seas to cross and planes hunting down the slow tanks. \\n\\nThe game has been inspired by the Classic Empire (some \\80s version of it). This can be seen in the gameplay that has been kept simple on purpose: quick to master & closer to the original.

You must fight off the waves of zombies before they smash your shelter\\s barricades and start munching on your brains.\\n\\nYou choose your survival strategy when you build your deck. Do you pack as many guns into your deck as you can? Do you use traps and reinforce your defenses? Do you stun stronger zombies and pick off the weak ones? You have the freedom to play as you want.\\n\\nAs you win duels, you will be rewarded with new cards to work into your deck and streamline your play style. You will also meet allies throughout the campaign who you take into battle with you.

Choose your punishments - From a simple threat, mark, or black eye to something more stringent like a stabbing, robbery, or killing.

Recollect is our third installment of memory training games, and is highly premised upon empirical data derived from its predecessors. Recollect maintains the effective framework of previous installments, but takes a leap forward by incorporating additional cognitive challenges and features intended to generalize the effectiveness of the program into an asesctic side-scroll platform.\\n\\nRecollect has been designed for all age groups interested in fun and effective brain-training. Based on over a decade of cognitive and neuroscience research, Recollect incorporates scientifically supported renditions of N-Back, Item Span, and Multiple-Identity tracking tasks. These tasks are independently shown to improve working memory in a manner that transfers to untrained tasks. \\n\\nRecollect is the product of a multi-faceted research project to answer questions related to working memory improvement, brain plasticity, and issues surrounding attention and reinforcement within cognitive training programs. Players are immersed into a game environment where they must perform and improve upon different cognitive tasks in order to advance to new realms and unlock advanced features. Our cognitive tasks are coupled together in a reward based framework that reinforces user adherence to the program and maintain training efficacy. \\n\\nThe premise of the game is set in a multi-world universe where the player is an astronaut (Lerner) tasked with collecting resources for the last human space colony. The player must explore planets in order to gather the necessary plants and minerals needed to feed the colony and keep their technology working. Players will experience that the required resources and planets are tricky, as resources must be collected in specific sequences to prevent them from quickly deteriorating, and planets are riddled with hazardous materials and obstacles. The mission is to help Lerner navigate the perilous terrain by using her memory skills to safely gather the resources. The fate of the human race rests on your shoulders!","Developer":"University of California Riverside","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":522730496,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paint-drop-a-splash-of-color/id1028708580","Name":"Paint Drop: A Splash of Color","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple19/v4/d2/ff/b6/d2ffb6d6-d587-4b5e-98ad-bdf74f46bf1a/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Happy one year of Paint Drop!\\n\\nPaint Drop is a colorful game with a simple goal; collect as many falling paint drops as you can.

And dont forget to keep less unmatched balloons at the end of level , because less un-match block equals less penalty. \\n\\nYou can use points & coin earned from the previous level to proceed next level if you fail to pass current level. The points added for a particular group match is displayed in the top of the screen. So understand it and play accordingly. \\n\\nThanks for playing.

In these typical French countryside landscapes, thousands of men are about to fight. And die. Bravely like heroes, or cowardly like wussies. But only heroes really matter. Those you see in Hollywood Golden Age war movies. Here lies the inspiration for Heroes of Normandie; here is what the game has to offer: explosive and fast-paced battles; the pleasure of butchering your enemies through MG42 walls of lead; and the ability to crush Nazi bastards under tons of shells \\u2013 basically, blood and guts.\\n\\nA miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy wargame inspired by Hollywood war movies. A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.

The war began in 1775 when the American colonies rebelled against the British Empire, declaring their independence in 1776.  In the following years, Britain tried to end the revolt and recapture the American territories.  The rebels however had support from Europe, with France and Spain later joining the war as allies to their cause.  A decisive American victory at Yorktown in 1781 broke the British resolve and was a catalyst in starting peace negotiations.  The war ended in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and global recognition of the sovereignty of the United States.\\n\\nKey Game Features\\n\\n\\u25cf 5 Mission Tutorial Campaign.\\n\\u25cf 4 Mission \\u2018Evolution Campaign.\\n\\u25cf 4 Mission \\u2018Nemesis Campaign.\\n\\u25cf All missions, apart from the tutorial, can be played as both sides.\\n\\u25cf 37 different historical models representing 26 different unit types.\\n\\u25cf Three classes of troop quality \\u2013 Raw, Average and Veteran.\\n\\u25cf New general quality mechanic, affecting command radius and leadership benefits. \\n\\u25cf 14 different troop classes including infantry (line, grenadiers, guard, and militia), light infantry (and j\\xe4gars), light cavalry (light dragoons and hussars), dragoons and artillery (4pdr and 6pdr).\\n\\u25cf 5 types of infantry formation - Line, Column, Open Order, Square, Unformed.\\n\\u25cf New joint Artillery and infantry formations, allowing for effective and resilient combined units.\\n\\u25cf New troop morale mechanic (Disruption)\\n\\u25cf New light woods that block line of sight but dont give a defensive bonus.\\n\\u25cf Detailed Combat Analysis \\n\\u25cf Map zoom\\n\\u25cf Flank Attacks \\n\\u25cf Strategic Movement \\n\\u25cf Game Centre Achievements and Leaderboards.\\n\\u25cf iCloud Saves.\\n\\nFind us on Facebook \\u2013 facebook.com/HexWar\\nFollow us on Twitter - @HexwarGames \\nGame Forum - hexwar.com/forums \\n\\nThank you for supporting our games! \\n\\n\\xa9 2015 HexWar Games Ltd.\\n\\xa9 2014 Decision Games, Inc\\nAll Rights Reserved.","Developer":"HexWar Games Ltd","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":219542528,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rnr-bingo/id1037886077","Name":"RnR Bingo","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/73/0b/8a/730b8a67-043d-02df-844e-e8229cad8a2e/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Play Bingo for free while you Rock around the world and visit Santa Monica, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Egypt and much more!

The game is classed as finished when there are no spaces left on the board or there are no more possible legal moves for either competitor\\n\\nBoth players begin the game with two pieces on the board in the four centre squares.

A legal move is one that consists of, for example, a black piece being placed on the board that creates a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) made up of a black piece at either end and only white pieces in between. When a player achieves this, they must complete the move by turning any white pieces in between the two black so that they line becomes entirely black. This turning action must be completed for every legal turning line that is created with the placing of the new piece.\\n\\nIt goes without say that while the example assumes the use of black as the moving player, it is applicable both ways.\\n\\nPlayers will then continue to move alternately until they get to the end of the game and a winner is decided.

The program was devised with pencil and paper, the calculations being performed manually by Turing and Champernowne themselves - each move would take them half an hour or more to calculate.\\n\\nThis app includes an implementation of the original TuroChamp, so you can play the original version, as conceived in 1947, without having to carry out all those tedious pencil and paper calculations. We\\ve also added deeper search and a more modern version of the engine, so you can play a stronger version of Turing\\s machine - up to around 2000 Elo. Finally, we\\ve added puzzles, practice levels and various two-player modes, so that you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\\n\\nTuroChamp still holds up well despite its idiosynchratic playing style (a style entirely appropriate to the incisive, determined and eccentrically humorous character of its creators). Perhaps more significantly, it represents the only A.I. left to us by the father of Artificial Intelligence.\\n\\nOther features include:\\n\\n- Support for all skill levels from total novice to expert (2000 Elo).\\n- Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand.\\n- Supports iOS multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks.\\n- Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board.\\n- Two player mode over BlueTooth / Lan.\\n- Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.\\n- Puzzles and practice levels, so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels.\\n- Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player.\\n- Various different boards, pieces and graphical options.\\n- Elo rating estimation from your game results.","Developer":"DBRG Ltd.","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":198819840,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/three-jumps-tv/id1045127916","Name":"Three Jumps TV","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/bb/36/6d/bb366d3b-333f-361d-a5b7-d59456fa2223/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"How far can you jump?\\n\\nGoal:\\nTry to avoid the black obstacles and jump as far as possible.\\n\\nHow-to:\\nYou have 3 jumps until you touch the floor so you get additional 3 jumps.

Two worlds with  60 different levels. 120 levels in total! Each world contains several mines with varied and interesting powers (explosive mine, freezing mine, ticking mine, bubble mine,...)\\n\\nIn this minesweeper puzzles, you have several levels and it\\s a great challenge to find all the mines ! \\n\\nTo clear a mine, simply touch and hold your finger on the tile that you think to be a mine. To win, you can also break all the other tiles, avoiding mines. Each land contains the explosive mine and a specific mine.\\n\\nMISCELLANEOUS WORLDS\\n-------------------------------------\\nClimb around the Upside-down world and visit the four lands:\\n- The jungle and greenery mines\\n- The icy world and freezing mines\\n- The pink world and the lost memory mines\\n- The dark world and ticking mines\\n\\nNavigate underwater without having to end the first world:\\n- The kingdom of the giant crab and bubble mines\\n- The sleeping octopus with mini octopus mines\\n- The secretive clams\\n- The white explosing mines\\n\\nREWARDS\\n--------------------\\nGet each day reward of gold bars or power!

You can also get free gold bars watching a video.\\n\\nAt each achievement you do, you receive free gold bars (eg first level, 5th level, 3 straight victory ...)\\n\\nAIDS\\n-------------------------\\nDuring the game, with the gold bars, you can use helpers (at the bottom left of the game screen). These aids are really useful when you are stranded in the game. The aids are filled automatically when you pop free squares.\\n\\nThe first aid targets a free space and pop it. The second puts some magic powder on several free tiles that you can pop safely. The last and most powerful displays for a few seconds the location of all mines.\\n\\nTUTORIAL:\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nA tutorial is available to help you to understand how to play. Bellow a detailed explanation of the minesweeper game:\\n\\nThe goal is to clear a minefield without detonating the mines. You see first a grid of identical squares. Some random and unknown squares contain a mine.\\n\\nThe game is played by revealing squares of the grid by touching them with your finger. \\n\\nIf a square containing a black mine is revealed, you lose the game. If a square containing a special mine is revealed, the mine explodes and handicaps are added to the grid, for example, filling the already discovered squares.\\n\\nIf a free square is revealed, a number appears in this square with the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. If this number is zero then the square appears empty, and the surrounding squares are automatically revealed. Using logic, you can in many case use these numbers to deduce the locations of mines or free squares. In case of mine, you can protect the square and capture a mine by adding a flag with a long touch on the screen.\\n\\nThe game is won when all squares containing mines are located and protected with a flag. In this case, the unrevealed squares are automatically revealed and the next level unlocked.\\n\\nThe game contains many levels in different worlds. The first levels are easy, but the difficulty increases gradually as the game advances. Each world contains a different special mine. A grid contains black mines, special mines or both.\\n\\nMoreover you have a limited number of moves available to find all the mines. \\n\\nIf you have no more live, you can invite Facebook friends to play and you receive a life back!
