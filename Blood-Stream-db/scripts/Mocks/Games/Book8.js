Congo Merc puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.   Missions include everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.   Once a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an event occurs. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts.

As you move from level to level, your paddle gets smaller and the balls get faster.  You can change the ball sounds and many other settings in the game.

Fill in all the hidden color of a line and then press ok to go to the next line.  -If in your proposition, one or more colors are in the hidden code, but not at the right place, a white dot will appear on the square at the right of the game board, corresponding to the colors misplaced.  -If in your proposition, one or more colors are in the hidden code and at the right place, a blue dot will appear in the square besides the game board.  -If in your proposition, there is no right color at all, black dots will appear in the square.  ==> The goal is to guess the right colors code as quickly as possible! <==  So what are you waiting for?

For centuries, Tic-tac-toe was a game limited to one tiny grid of nine squares, devoid of strategy \\tand filled with draws.  Prepare to say goodbye to pen and paper simplicity, and say hello to TAC!  The rules are familiar, but with an imaginative twist!  This classic puzzle has been expanded and reimagined into a unique and epic variation on an all-ages favorite!  YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY But you don\\u2019t!  TAC is played on a huge 3x3 grid called the Big Board.  Each of the nine squares are actually tic-tac-toe games of their own.  The gameplay in each of these squares, called the Little Boards, is familiar.  Players take turns placing either X\\u2019s or O\\u2019s in an effort to attain three in a row.  THE TWIST Every turn is a strategic dance.  Each placement you make on the Little Board determines which square your opponent gets to move to on the Big Board.  You can either gain advantage on the Little Board or force your opponent to play in a certain square.  Move wisely!  SCORE There are two ways to win!   1)  Score three in a row on the Big Board!  If you win on a little board, it\\u2019s like selecting a square on the big board.  If you succeed in lining up a trio of wins on the big board, you win!   2)  Dominate the big board!  If you earn more squares on the big board than your opponent, you win!  Challenge your Facebook buddies or square off against strangers.  Take on an AI opponent and perfect your strategy.

Key Features   1775: Rebellion features simple and unique game mechanics and special attention to historical detail. Experience this critical time in American history, you will not be disappointed!   - 3 Scenarios \\u2013 1775, 1775 (Short) and Siege of Quebec.  - Play solo vs. 3 AI difficulties  - 54 Cards (Movement & Event)  - Cross-platform online play or up to 4 player hotseat multiplayer.  - Faithful conversion of the original board game.  About the Game   1775: Rebellion is based on the award winning board game developed by Academy Games.   The mapboard represents the original 13 Colonies plus Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony. Player controlled factions include the Continental Army, Patriot Militia, British Regulars and Loyalist Militia. In addition to this the Allied French and Allied Hessian factions, which are controlled by American and British forces respectively, can be brought into the game by event cards playable by each faction.   Each game is played in a series of rounds. Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction. It is entirely possible for a faction to go last in a previous round only to go first in the next.   Movement & Events   Every Faction has a deck of cards consisting of Event cards, Movement cards, and one Truce card. Every turn, each faction will play a movement card to maneuver their troops and any number of event cards. When both factions of a side (British or American) have played their truce cards, the game will end! Each deck has a specific number of movement cards in it and managing them is an important part of the game.   Each faction has a Truce card which serves not only as a timer for the game but as a powerful Movement card. However, a game may end prematurely if both factions of a side are forced to play it early in the game.

The game allow players to portray important engagements throughout WWI history. The battles focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system.  The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top. The Command card system drives movement, creates a \\u201cfog of war\\u201d and presents players with many interesting opportunities; while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently.

Your task is to build towns, populate them with workers, and make sure that they are housed, fed, and entertained. You\\u2019ll have to manage and coordinate extensive production and trade networks to make sure your towns thrive.  Key Features Of 1849  - A campaign mode that traces the development of the Gold Rush from mining camps to bustling cities. Each city scenario presents players with unique starting conditions, victory goals, and obstacle events.  - Sandbox mode with a procedurally-generated map for your location, based on geography (from the Pacific coast to the Sierra Nevada mountains), precipitation, resource availability, and starting lot size.  - Vivid old west towns with buildings lining the streets directly inspired by California\\u2019s Gold Country.  - Over 50 resources that players can dig up, farm, refine or manufacture as they build complex towns and cities.   1849: Nevada Silver expands on 1849\\u2019s simulation gameplay to provide more challenge on a bustling new frontier.  - Six new Nevada city scenarios, from frontier outposts to bustling boom towns, plus sandbox mode  - Train-based trading system adds a new strategic dimension  - New buildings, mines, and resources based on the industry and technology of the era  The Epilogue presents two final scenarios, taking place in the period after the gold rush, as the people of California attempted to forge a new identity in a state that went through an irreversible transformation.  1849 is a neat city builder which works well within its theme and is quite satisfying to play if you enjoy city-builders. - Lena LeRay, IndieGames.com  1849 seems to be an accurate simulator in terms of its focus on 1850s city building.

Put on a uniform, fill up a gun and show them who is the boss.   Mice Invasion is an action game where you have to fight army of attacking mice trying to steal everything from your farm even your underwear. Your task is to prevent them doing so at any costs. In the role of a brave tomcat, you stand behind your loyal cannon and defend the farm. Dont be mistaken it seems like an easy task but its definitely not. There are lots of them and their muskets aim really precisely.   There are 45 levels full of action prepared for you. During these, you will meet four kinds of mouse attackers on three different battlefields. Gradually, you will be finding new kinds of ammunition for your loyal gun.  Besides the level mode, you can play survival mode where you choose a battlefield and face the endless floods of enemies. If you are competitive you can measure your skill with your friends or other players in online score. Can you be the best?   Game principle is easy. A cat with a gun is placed in the lower part of a screen, you move sideways with a gun by tilting a mobile device and shoot by tapping on the screen. Mice are going from the top of the screen, every now and then they stop, aim and shoot. Each received shot lowers cat\\u2019s determination to protect the farm as well as every mouse slipping through its barricade. When the determination reaches zero, game ends; but dont worry, you can try it again.  One last thing you will not manage with only shooting and dodging. The game is not about fast reflexes only. To successfully repulse all attacking waves it is necessary to use different kinds of ammunition and their bonuses correctly. SPOILER: focus on higher enemy ranks which provide individual waves with various bonuses; when they run away, a wave loses these bonuses.  Information about enemy soldiers, cannon ammunition and control is described in Help page in the game.    In a nutshell:  \\u2022\\t45 levels full of action \\u2022\\t4 kinds of enemies \\u2022\\t4 + 1 kinds of ammunition \\u2022\\t3 different battlefields \\u2022\\tSurvival mode with online rankings \\u2022\\tChallenges (can you complete them all?)  \\u2022\\tAll this in a beautiful animated graphics inspired by the period of the Napoleonic Wars    If you like the game, you can buy additional uniform sets for the enemy soldiers as well as for the cat defender in the shop. You can buy cool ammunition, too. However, this ammunition is not necessary to finish the game (all levels can be completed without using it :)).

Playing like a hybrid of a collectible card game and the castle defense genre, Shelter Free will provide you with hours of challenging play.  Defend yourself from the zombie onslaught as you fight to be reunited with the woman you love. You define your strategy, but be warned...  ...You\\ll need to adapt to survive.  Features:  - Deep but accessible gameplay. Easy to learn. Hard to master. - More than 100 game cards. - Integrated deck builder for deeply customizable play. - Graphic novel & comic inspired hand drawn artwork. - Compelling story and characters. - 5 Campaign levels including a free roaming level.  Details:  The inspiration for Shelter comes from the desire to combine the complex, rich gaming mechanics of collectible card dueling games with the simple accessible gameplay of the castle defense genre.  Shelter is an asymmetric single-player card game where you build a deck of dueling cards and take them into battle against a zombie deck that plays itself. The zombie deck is not controlled by a hideously complex AI, but plays based on a simple set of rules with dice rolls to add the element of chance. You must fight off the waves of zombies before they smash your shelter\\s barricades and start munching on your brains.  You choose your survival strategy when you build your deck. Do you pack as many guns into your deck as you can? Do you use traps and reinforce your defenses? Do you stun stronger zombies and pick off the weak ones? You have the freedom to play as you want.  As you win duels, you will be rewarded with new cards to work into your deck and streamline your play style. You will also meet allies throughout the campaign who you take into battle with you.

Recollect is our third installment of memory training games, and is highly premised upon empirical data derived from its predecessors. Recollect maintains the effective framework of previous installments, but takes a leap forward by incorporating additional cognitive challenges and features intended to generalize the effectiveness of the program into an asesctic side-scroll platform.  Recollect has been designed for all age groups interested in fun and effective brain-training. Based on over a decade of cognitive and neuroscience research, Recollect incorporates scientifically supported renditions of N-Back, Item Span, and Multiple-Identity tracking tasks. These tasks are independently shown to improve working memory in a manner that transfers to untrained tasks.   Recollect is the product of a multi-faceted research project to answer questions related to working memory improvement, brain plasticity, and issues surrounding attention and reinforcement within cognitive training programs. Players are immersed into a game environment where they must perform and improve upon different cognitive tasks in order to advance to new realms and unlock advanced features. Our cognitive tasks are coupled together in a reward based framework that reinforces user adherence to the program and maintain training efficacy.   The premise of the game is set in a multi-world universe where the player is an astronaut (Lerner) tasked with collecting resources for the last human space colony. The player must explore planets in order to gather the necessary plants and minerals needed to feed the colony and keep their technology working. Players will experience that the required resources and planets are tricky, as resources must be collected in specific sequences to prevent them from quickly deteriorating, and planets are riddled with hazardous materials and obstacles. The mission is to help Lerner navigate the perilous terrain by using her memory skills to safely gather the resources.

Play begins by selecting one of the six pits on the players side of the game board. Moving counter-clockwise, one stone is dropped in each pit.

If the player lands in an empty pit on their side of the board, they capture their stone and all the stones in the pit on the opposite side of the board.

The world is your game board and you are a dot moving around. DOT is not played as any other mobile game, but is played in real life! The game technology is based on GPS information from your mobile phone and as a DOT player, you have to move around physically to be part of the game.  DOT resembles the classic game of tag, but combines the well-known game mechanics with elements of geocaching, live-action-gaming and urban exploration. DOT can be played in familiar surroundings by a small group, or on a massive scale encompassing your whole city.  In the game you are a coloured DOT. On your phone you will be able to see the proximity and direction of your fellow DOT players. You must catch and absorb the colour from dots in other colors by using your DOT Boost. The aim is to catch as many DOTs as possible without getting your own colour absorbed by another player.

The Object of the game is to score on each roll of the dice.   You start each round with 6 Dice to roll, and select scoring dice, with each roll.   Try NOT to \\u201cFarkle\\u201d (roll without scoring points)!  A Farkle is a roll, which no dice scores points.   Score as many points as possible in 10 Rounds, with 100,000 points being the big goal.   2\\u2019s, 3\\u2019s, 4\\u2019s 6\\u2019s are scoreless unless in a Straight (5 or 6 Straight), or 3, 4, 5 or 6 of a kind.   The more scoring dice you select in your rack, equally reduces the number of dice available for the following roll, until all of the 6 Dice are scored.   You can continue to roll in each round, until you run out of dice, or Farkle.   Scored points can be banked by clicking \\u201cTap To Bank\\u201d, or clicking on the green highlighted score bar, if you sense a Farkle roll coming, and you dont want to risk loosing your points.  For better understanding, check the instructions about scoring.  We have a Secret Tip for You: On your very first round of every game, you can keep playing over and over, without banking your score, until an excellent score rolls up! This will boost your final game score big time (shhhh, don\\u2019t tell the house!).    *****************************   The Selfie Zoo Collections Mission is to Help to Raise Worldwide Awareness to the Animal Rights - in a Fun Way. :)   Download the Full Collection of The SELFIE ZOO \\xa9 Games!

In each round, you roll the dice and score the result in 1 of 13 categories.  You must score exactly once in each category. Skill and judgement are required as the game progresses, and your options start to ran out.  The aim of the game is to get the highest score from 13 rounds, with 3 rolls per hand.  A Yatzy (5 of a kind) is 50 points, but a second Yatzy yields a bonus of 100 points.  Try to tick off all 13 dice combinations.  Use Game-Center to track accomplishments and compare your best scores to others around the world.  Secret Tips:  Conserve the easy combinations (like the multiples of 1\\s, 2\\s, 3\\s, 4\\s, 5\\s, 6\\s, and Chance) for when you need them.  Aim for the most difficult dice combinations, such as Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight and Five of A Kind / Yatzy.   *****************************   The Selfie Zoo Collection\\s Mission is to Help to Raise Worldwide Awareness to the Animal Rights - in a Fun Way. :)   Download the Full Collection of The SELFIE ZOO \\xa9 Games!

The war began in 1775 when the American colonies rebelled against the British Empire, declaring their independence in 1776.  In the following years, Britain tried to end the revolt and recapture the American territories.  The rebels however had support from Europe, with France and Spain later joining the war as allies to their cause.  A decisive American victory at Yorktown in 1781 broke the British resolve and was a catalyst in starting peace negotiations.  The war ended in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and global recognition of the sovereignty of the United States.

More than 100 million peoples from over 30 countries are involved. These made World War 2 to be the deadliest conflict in human history.  German conquests : in World War 2, Germany sought to defeat its opponents in a series of short campaigns in Europe continent. Germany quickly overran much of Europe and was victorious for more than two years. Germany defeated and occupied Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Yet Germany did not defeat Great Britain, which was protected from German ground attack by the English Channel and the Royal Navy. German forces suddenly invaded the Soviet Union. But Germany proved unable to defeat the Soviet Union, which together with Great Britain and the United States turned the tide of battle and ultimately defeated Germany in May 1945.

Each tower must built in the right area, because it will have a big impact to the war result. When the condition going bad or uncontrollable, you can call the back up squad by push the \\u201cmissile\\u201d or \\u201cthunderbolt\\u201d button. Buumm! Instant kill! The Germany axis army come in various squad form combination like : land troop, air squadron, and water troop. When one enemy troop can pass through your defense, you will lose one of your heart bar. This game made with balanced, so the two party has equal power.

How to Play Othello:  Players battle to finish the game with more of their own pieces on the board than their opponent. The game is classed as finished when there are no spaces left on the board or there are no more possible legal moves for either competitor  Both players begin the game with two pieces on the board in the four centre squares. No two matching colours are connected vertically or horizontally so a miniature chequered pattern is made. In the typical set ups where it is black versus white the person using black chips must make the first move.  Both players take it in turns to make their move which consists of placing one piece down in a legally acceptable position and then turning any of the opposing player\\u2019s pieces where applicable. A legal move is one that consists of, for example, a black piece being placed on the board that creates a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) made up of a black piece at either end and only white pieces in between. When a player achieves this, they must complete the move by turning any white pieces in between the two black so that they line becomes entirely black. This turning action must be completed for every legal turning line that is created with the placing of the new piece.  It goes without say that while the example assumes the use of black as the moving player, it is applicable both ways.  Players will then continue to move alternately until they get to the end of the game and a winner is decided. This decision is reached by identifying which of the two opponents has the most pieces on the board.

In 1947, Alan Turing and David Champernowne created the world\\s first chess playing computer program, which they called TuroChamp. The program was devised with pencil and paper, the calculations being performed manually by Turing and Champernowne themselves - each move would take them half an hour or more to calculate.  This app includes an implementation of the original TuroChamp, so you can play the original version, as conceived in 1947, without having to carry out all those tedious pencil and paper calculations. We\\ve also added deeper search and a more modern version of the engine, so you can play a stronger version of Turing\\s machine - up to around 2000 Elo. Finally, we\\ve added puzzles, practice levels and various two-player modes, so that you can use your device as a virtual chessboard.  TuroChamp still holds up well despite its idiosynchratic playing style (a style entirely appropriate to the incisive, determined and eccentrically humorous character of its creators). Perhaps more significantly, it represents the only A.I. left to us by the father of Artificial Intelligence.  Other features include:  - Support for all skill levels from total novice to expert (2000 Elo). - Supports all orientations, so you can make full use of your iPad Smart Case or stand. - Supports iOS multitasking, so you can follow along with videos/ebooks. - Focus mode, to hide the UI so you can focus on the board. - Two player mode over BlueTooth / Lan. - Tabletop mode so you can use your device as a virtual chessboard. - Puzzles and practice levels, so you can practice your endgames or play some interesting challenge levels. - Mini-tournament mode - a six-game mini tournament mode for the more serious player. - Various different boards, pieces and graphical options. - Elo rating estimation from your game results.', Developer: 'DBRG Ltd.', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 198819840, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/three-jumps-tv/id1045127916', Name: 'Three Jumps TV', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/bb/36/6d/bb366d3b-333f-361d-a5b7-d59456fa2223/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'How far can you jump?

Otherwise they are called the defenders. -\\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks.

Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point. -\\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit.  -\\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds. -\\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9.  -\\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit. -\\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9. -\\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit. -\\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit. -\\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit. -\\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points. -\\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made. -\\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre. -\\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred. -\\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M. -\\tThe defenders are marked with a D.  * Support and Feedback If you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Two worlds with  60 different levels. 120 levels in total! Each world contains several mines with varied and interesting powers (explosive mine, freezing mine, ticking mine, bubble mine,...)  In this minesweeper puzzles, you have several levels and it\\s a great challenge to find all the mines !   To clear a mine, simply touch and hold your finger on the tile that you think to be a mine. To win, you can also break all the other tiles, avoiding mines. Each land contains the explosive mine and a specific mine.  MISCELLANEOUS WORLDS ------------------------------------- Climb around the Upside-down world and visit the four lands: - The jungle and greenery mines - The icy world and freezing mines - The pink world and the lost memory mines - The dark world and ticking mines  Navigate underwater without having to end the first world: - The kingdom of the giant crab and bubble mines - The sleeping octopus with mini octopus mines - The secretive clams - The white explosing mines  REWARDS -------------------- Get each day reward of gold bars or power! You can also get free gold bars by watching a video. You can also get free gold bars watching a video.  At each achievement you do, you receive free gold bars (eg first level, 5th level, 3 straight victory ...)  AIDS ------------------------- During the game, with the gold bars, you can use helpers (at the bottom left of the game screen). These aids are really useful when you are stranded in the game. The aids are filled automatically when you pop free squares.  The first aid targets a free space and pop it. The second puts some magic powder on several free tiles that you can pop safely. The last and most powerful displays for a few seconds the location of all mines.  TUTORIAL: ----------------------------------------------------------------- A tutorial is available to help you to understand how to play. Bellow a detailed explanation of the minesweeper game:  The goal is to clear a minefield without detonating the mines. You see first a grid of identical squares. Some random and unknown squares contain a mine.  The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by touching them with your finger.   If a square containing a black mine is revealed, you lose the game. If a square containing a special mine is revealed, the mine explodes and handicaps are added to the grid, for example, filling the already discovered squares.  If a free square is revealed, a number appears in this square with the number of adjacent squares that contain mines. If this number is zero then the square appears empty, and the surrounding squares are automatically revealed. Using logic, you can in many case use these numbers to deduce the locations of mines or free squares. In case of mine, you can protect the square and capture a mine by adding a flag with a long touch on the screen.  The game is won when all squares containing mines are located and protected with a flag. In this case, the unrevealed squares are automatically revealed and the next level unlocked.  The game contains many levels in different worlds. The first levels are easy, but the difficulty increases gradually as the game advances. Each world contains a different special mine. A grid contains black mines, special mines or both.  Moreover you have a limited number of moves available to find all the mines.   If you have no more live, you can invite Facebook friends to play and you receive a life back! Go in option Menu to use the invite button, or wait to have 0 life.  If you have an Apple Watch , you can play Minesweeper on! Discreet and fun!
