WINNING: A player wins the game by completely destroying the opposing army by capturing all the ants.  Ant War Games is a two player board game. It is like Checkers and Chess because pieces can move in many different directions. It is also like the game of Go since the object is to capture enemy pieces and dominate the territory. The goal is to try to capture opponents by making an aggressive move forward the opponent. Moving toward an opponent captures all of the opponents that lie along the same line.

Following Anglo-Saxon traditional sorcery you will learn to exercise your wiglung to anticipate and foresee how best to arrange the runes in order to optimize your weird (fate).  This game has puzzled the minds of many for hundreds of years.  Pit your wits against the fates and see if you are clever enough to solve the mysteries of the runes.  In the training version you will be able to undo moves and receive hints where to place runes.  Such actions erase all gains you have made.  Your score will reset as will any bonus accumulators you\\u2019ve earned.  So, use them wisely.  This version of the game is meant to allow you, at a cost, to explore various alternatives and teach you how to look ahead.  Taking in all the details that surround you and foreseeing probabilities and potential is the bread and butter of Anglo-Saxon sorcery.  Anglo-Sax sorcerers do not predict the future, they see the potential of all futures that could be and then choose and influence the one they want the most to occur.  You earn sorcery points by making 4 way connections.  These are the most difficult to make happen, however, fortune favors the lucky just the same.  Earn enough sorcery points with the classic game to unlock the Apprentice and Mastery versions. Good luck young sorcerer.  It was believed that TOAG or Ishido was a means to divine the future.  A game of chance that also offered a glimpse of future events.  It teaches us that if we can perceive the possibilities before us we can better prepare for them in the future.  TOAG (Ishido) was a training tool for ancient prophets who sought to learn the timely craft of seeing into the future.  THE RULES There are 72 tiles, two of each combination of six colors and six icons. For example, there is 2 Red Feathers, 2 Blue Feathers, 2 Green Feathers, 2 White Feathers, 2 Purple Feathers, and 2 Yellow Feathers.  There are 5 other icons with the same color configuration making a total of 72 tiles.  At the start of the game six tiles are placed on the board automatically which are drawn from the bag of tiles after they have been shuffled.  To place an additional tile on the board, you must match at least one adjacent tile according to the restrictions listed below.  Each time you place a tile a random tile is drawn from the bag of tiles.  You play until either you can no longer place a tile on the board or you have emptied your bag of 72 tiles.  To match a single tile, you must match either the color or shape.  To match two tiles, you must match one shape and one color.  To match three tiles, you must match two colors and one shape OR two shapes and one color.  To match four tiles, you must match two colors and two shapes.  When placing a tile you must consider those tiles which are adjacent to the location you want to place the tile at.  You can not place a tile on top of a tile.  If the space you want to place the tile at has 3 adjacent tiles you must match all three according to the restrictions listed above and so on.  As you get further along in the game placing tiles will become increasingly more difficult.  The strategy of the game is understanding how many colors of which tiles have already been drawn and which still remain in the bag.  By carefully placing key tiles on the board you can plan for the arrival of certain tiles to score greater points.  The more tiles you match with each placement of a tile the more points you will be awarded.  Tiles placed on the interior (lighter) squares score points when placed according to the number of adjacent tiles that they match.  Tiles placed outside the interior award no points (Traveling the interior of the board is a step of progress and risk, walking only at its perimeter is the safe mans journey which ultimately takes you in circles).', Developer: 'Evan Schwartz', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 87687168, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitchy-thrones/id898649182', Name: 'Twitchy Thrones', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/f5/9c/0b/f59c0bbc-4070-dc78-e66c-9c04ea05f59d/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Twitchy Thrones is a fast and fun strategy game with a medieval fantasy setting.

Improve your chances by using logic to choose squares of land to excavate. Use clues to uncover gems and preserve green space by avoiding unnecessary digging.

Play alone or with a friend.  Gems are randomly placed in plots of land made up of squares of grass.

The goal is to excavate all of the gems in a plot of land, using clues to make better decisions about which squares to excavate.  A number in an excavated square indicates that gems are in that number of adjoining squares. Players can use that information to make decisions about   \\u2022  squares that either do or may contain gems and  \\u2022  squares that will not contain gems.   A square that reveals only dirt and rocks will have no gems in any adjacent square.

The strategy game features unique hand drawn map, complex morale, innovative controls and smart AI.   Ultimate general: Gettysburg is a critically acclaimed indie wargame with one of the highest user ratings for strategy games on Steam and Metacritic.    KEY FEATURES ==============  **Campaign The campaign is split into 10 historical missions from the first engagements to the famous \\u201cPickett\\u2019s charge\\u201d. Missions present different levels of complexity that will give you hours of gameplay.   **Unique Controls & Unit Self-Awareness The game plays in real time, but you can pause at any time to plan your strategy and give orders to units. Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces as if you are drawing them on the tactical map. Units do not need micromanagement, able to act on their own: re-aligning, switching targets, withdrawing and forming battle lines without player input.  **Smart AI  The AI commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting to your actions; fighting aggressively or defensively replicating actions of a competent human player. The game will provide the significant challenge on higher difficulty levels.  **Detailed Map of Gettysburg We used satellite images and historical maps, recreating important locations, houses, ridges and hills that are depicted as accurately as possible within the game\\u2019s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, but also you will be able to use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game.   **Advanced Line of Sight Elevation and obstructions will affect unit visibility realistically. Units will use concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware \\u2013 the AI will attempt to do the same.    **Tactics matter In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not \\u201cmachines\\u201d that blindly follow orders, but need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected from a strategy game is important for winning battles. Unite morale is affected by multiple factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue.   **Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders Ultimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Command famous brigades like the Iron Brigade, Louisiana Tigers, 1st Vermont, Bucktail Brigade, Gibraltar Brigade, Excelsior Brigade and many more.  **Differences with the PC version The game was redesigned from the ground up to provide good usability and playability on tablets. If you have played the game on the PC, the major change is in the campaign flow and in the user interface. The tactical combat and its features were tuned only slightly.

For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a cascading stack with top card 4 of hearts. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell or empty cascading stack.  MOVING CARDS: Tapping a card once will move it to a suit stack if a spot is available or to a pile with available higher card of different color. Double-tapping a card will move it to an open free cell. Alternatively, you can simply drag a card to where you want it to go. If an attempted move is not allowed, the card will shake.

The rules are simple: + The game is played by two players (two sets of hands facing each other). + The goal of the game is to get the opponents hands out of the game. + Both the player and the opponent begin with only ONE finger pointed on each hand. + Each play begins when one of the players selects one of his own hands and then selects one of his opponent\\s hands.     This causes the number of pointed fingers showing in the selected player\\s hand to copy to the selected opponent\\s hand.   The selected opponent\\s hand then changes to reflect the sum of the pointed fingers it was already showing plus the number of new fingers copied from the player.        If the sum reaches 5, that hand is out of the game.        If the sum is more than 5, the receiving player\\s hand will show the sum minus 5 (e.g. 3 fingers showing plus 3 fingers received equals 6 which would show as 1 finger (6-5)).  + Once both hands of the opponent have no pointed fingers and are out of the game, the game is over and the player with fingers still showing has won.', Developer: 'GreenShpits', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 11460608, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dominations/id922558758', Name: 'DomiNations', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a4/02/db/a402db4b-e285-15f8-d588-73432f342a46/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Battle nations from throughout history in DomiNations!

What if 2016 had gone differently, if perhaps your candidate had had a bit more money, been a better candidate, or just been a bit luckier? What if someone else had run? What if a third party candidate had just as much money to spend? Or maybe even significantly more? What could you do with a hundred million dollars? A billion? Ten billion? What if there were four competitive parties? How would that change things? What if there were no established parties running at all?  With Election Manager 2016 you can answer those questions and more... Try running an election on a shoestring or with an unfair advantage. Run as a Democrat or Republican, manage the Libertarian or Green ticket, or go completely independent. Let your adviser make all your decisions for you, or micromanage every decision yourself, or anything in-between. The choices are all up to you.  About the Game:  Election Manager 2016 is an abstract strategic election simulation game where you manage your ticket in an attempt to get your candidate elected to the office of President of the United States. Election Manager comes with a variety of scenarios, from a recreation of the 2012 election to a four-way election between independent parties. In addition, almost any imaginable two-to-four way election scenario can be designed by the player.  The Election Manager 2016 engine uses actual historical and demographic data to produce reasonable election results, taking into account factors such as partisan lean and voter elasticity. The player will not only have to consider states but also media markets, giving the game a strategic dimension due the inefficient mapping from one to the other. For instance, to target New Jerseys 14 electoral votes, the player would have to spend money on ads in the Philadelphia or New York City markets \\u2014 but significant portions of those markets are actually in other states. So is it really worth spending that money there, or would it be better spent going after other states instead?  While Election Manager aims to give you complete control of your strategy, it also comes with tools to help you manage it \\u2014 up to and including an AI campaign manager to which you can delegate any part (or all) of your strategy, from campaign stops to ad buys to state offices to polling. Game features include:  \\u2022 Completely customizable scenarios, including pre-built 2012 and hypothetical 2016 scenarios \\u2022 Scenarios for two to four parties \\u2022 Run a Democratic ticket, a Republican ticket, or any number of third-party or independent tickets \\u2022 Single player or hotseat multiplayer \\u2022 Set up campaign and fundraising stops for your candidate \\u2022 Plan your ad strategy for every market in the United States \\u2022 Use ads to attack your opponent, or boost your campaign with positive ads \\u2022 Set up campaign offices in battleground states \\u2022 Handle everything yourself, delegate everything to your AI campaign advisor, or anything in-between \\u2022 Tools to help you plan your polling or ad campaigns or budgeting \\u2022 Data and maps and lots of it', Developer: 'Lensflare Games LLC', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 63550464, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tictactoe-black/id923822483', Name: 'TicTacToe black', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/61/f8/c8/61f8c8d5-dc9e-7af7-0360-912fc246211c/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Simple tic tac toe game with Blackboard-like graphic and sounds.', Developer: 'Luca Naddei', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 7487488, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storage-empire-pawn-wars/id923822987', Name: 'Storage Empire: Pawn Wars', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/92/aa/c5/92aac558-02e9-ccda-df18-6dbc09a6deef/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Storage Empire - the 1st free auction game with multiplayer and life-like items to win.

of enemies. Alone, you must defend Fort Ukala in a tower defense different from everything you ever played before. Think fast, create combos and develop a strategy to become the Magic Master.   - Intense action: you need to think fast to defeat opponents. - Fire, Ice and more: learn to master his powers to excel in war. - Combos: combine magic spells and create even more powerful effects. - Epic: control a single mage who faces alone countless enemies. - Fearful Enemies: goblins, orcs, imps, gargoyles, dragons, giants and more. - Customize magical towers and improve your strategy. - Join your Facebook friends to get to the top. - New resources and levels will be added frequently.  You are one of the last Masters of the Arcane Order and also Ukala\\s last line of defense. Survive the relentless attacks and assaults of the Blood Horde with eight powers and numerous combinations of them. Magic Master\\s gameplay uses touches and gestures on the screen to activate magical powers like the stone column, which prevents the passage of enemies, or the flamethrower that burns all in its path.  But to succeed you need to combine these spells like this: trigger a wave of psychic energy to knock down a stone column on your enemies or summon a tornado to maximize the effect of flamethrowers are some examples.

The Cambodian transitive verb \\u201cRek\\u201d means \\u2018carry on one\\u2019s shoulder a pole at each end of which is a container, bundle or object. It was pointed out that the game was popular among military troops. Today, it is also played by Cambodian women.  Objective The object of the game is to \\u201ccapture\\u201d instead of checkmate the opponent\\u2019s King. All units may be captured in two ways :     1- when they are \\u201cRek\\u201d by an enemy unit in the analogy that they are the containers carried away by that enemy unit. This later way of capture actually bears the name of the game.     2- when they are tightly surrounded or trapped by the enemy units and thus have no legal move.  It also has two different forces of 32 units in total . Each side starts with a force of 16 units: One King and 15 Men. All the Men have the same value and physical shape. And they all, including the Kings, move like the Boat or Rook.  Another Style of Play\\u200b (Taunt enemry to Rek) The Rek also has its own special style of play. It is named \\u201cMin Rek Chanh\\u201d (Not Rek Lose if opponent taunt). The object of the game is still the same, capturing the opponent\\u2019s King. But, there is only one legal way to capture the enemy units, including the King: \\u201cRek\\u201d them two at a time.  The Kings may not move at all, not even a square. They are \\u201cpalace kings\\u201d! Other setting features and opening setup are the same as those of the regular Rek. The unique characteristic of this style of play is that a player\\u2019s order of Rek to the other must be honored, otherwise the latter loses and the game is over. So, strategic and deliberate sacrifices are the mind set behind winning the game.  Usually the game is over when one player orders a \\u201cright\\u201d series of the opponent\\u2019s consecutive moves to \\u2018Rek\\u2019 his units which ultimately will lead to the capture or Rek of the opponent\\u2019s King in return.

Each level is made of a differently shaped grid of squares, and contains a variable amount of funny cute orange-colored robots and switches. To complete a level you must place a robot over each switch. Do it by dragging the robots horizontally or vertically. The tricky part is that the robots slide in a straight line until they hit an obstacle.  In the first levels you can move the robots without much thinking, and you will eventually succeed with a relative ease. But completing advanced levels is more challenging, and requires to think of a strategy before performing most moves. This is even more true if you want to reach the perfect score, the fewest moves needed to complete a level.  For each level, your best game (or fewest moves) is saved and can be replayed. This is useful if you want to improve or share your moves.

Your Vampire is alone against the world! You will need to master the dark arts to find your way to the tomb in each level, where you will  acquire new powers. Choose them wisely: there are many paths to success, but the slightest mistake can be fatal!  Winner of Best Game and Best Art at http://proceduraldeathjam.com/ in March 2014.  Tom Christiansen, http://www.gamezebo.com/2014/03/29/browser-pick-lamp-and-vamp/ Lamp and Vamp is an enjoyable strategy game where players must navigate a vampire to his coffin through a randomly generated neighborhood, while avoiding the local neighborhood watch, determined to catch them. Movement is based on a tile system, each turn the player can move to any adjacent tile, and the vampire hunters also move one tile. The catch is that the vampire hunters have torches and flashlights, and can see ahead. If the vampire is caught in the hunter\\s line-of-sight, all the hunters in the neighborhood will converge and attempt to corner the vampire, resulting in death.  Adam Smith http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/27/lamp-and-vamp-is-the-best-free-game/   It\\s a puzzle game in which you play a vampire who is trying to return to his coffin. Pesky townspeople and priests block the way but using your powers (BAT-FORM, MIST-FORM, BLOODSUCKING), you can navigate the streets and find your way home. It\\s absolutely splendid.  And Thomas Schulenberg in http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/30/lamp-and-vamp-vants-you-to-suck-blood-but-with-strategy/ If there\\s one thing that Lamp and Vamp has taught us, it\\s that being a vampire is tough. ^-^', Developer: 'GlobZ', Age_Rating: '9+', Size: 27271168, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frontline-the-longest-day/id935241858', Name: 'Frontline : The Longest Day', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/8b/54/cc/8b54cc01-a726-885d-5321-6aa519975843/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'June 6th, 1944.

The ball will only flash twice.  The first flash happens when the ball drops and the second flash happens on the line. You\\u2019re goal is to tap the screen when you think the ball will appear in the orange target area.  Cristiano Ronaldo can famously volley a corner kick in total darkness. The magic behind this remarkable feat is hidden in Cristiano\\u2019s brain which enables him to use advance cues to plan upcoming actions. Darkball challenges your brain to do the same, distilling that scenario into its simplest form - intercept a ball in the dark. All you see is all you need.  One of the brain\\u2019s fundamental functions is to use information from the past and present to predict the future. This function is key to how animals, from dragonflies to humans, navigate a dynamic and uncertain world. To make predictions, the brain must have an \\u201cinternal model\\u201d of the system it interacts with. A basic form of this function is at play when we move our body. For example, to reach for a cup, the brain must have a model to predict how the hand would respond to various motor commands. Internal models are also thought to play a crucial role when we mentally predict future states of the environment, for example when we track a ball as it moves behind another object. Here, we have designed a simple task to understand how the nervous system makes such predictions. In this task, subjects have to intercept a ball when it reaches its final position. By changing the speed of the ball, the intervals when it is invisible, and the target position, we will test various hypotheses about the algorithms that are used to integrate information about past and present to make predictions about future.', Developer: 'CW&T', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 3293184, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rool-for-american-roulette/id937466288', Name: 'ROOL for American Roulette', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/35/c2/a9/35c2a905-7dac-f8d2-1a05-c9f8badaf1bd/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'American roulette is unique. Only United States and CANADA have this version of the game, as people all over the world play European Roulette because of its known odd edge.

However, it has completely different layout of the wheel plus a double zero. Double zeroes helped casinos earn more profits and also made players lose a larger sum of money at a faster pace. Since our goal is to stop silly betting, and we got numerous messages asking if we have a version designed particularly for 00 Roulette. Here you go.  ROOL for American Roulette is intended to put the advantage in the hands of the roulette gamers, empowering him or her to make more exact wagers at the roulette wheel. By giving tools about the pattern studies of the wheel to foretell where the ball is possible to land, following the wheel\\s history and deciding its bias. ROOL could assist you to discover which numbers/regions are more prone to hit. Also, we made this application for helping addictive gamblers to increase more game sense!  Customer\\s Feedbacks (Collected from our emails):    Love your APPS... So far I made quite a lot of $$$$$$... I will comment on your website the great assistance and the Application itself.

VWT is well-documented amongst gamers - Visual Wheel Tracking. The movements of the roulette wheel are unsurprising, and figuring out the equation that dictates where the ball is going to land is more than possible if you have the aid of a computer. Obviously, you don\\t need to look at the air resistance and friction of the ball and the wheel. What you have to do is take a gander at all is the information we gave you and figured out the most hit regions. Spotlight on that territory, and you\\ll win.  Why would it be a good idea for you to download this application?  Answer: House does undermine you, every one of those machines are situated up to TAKE your cash and not to provide for you any,  by what means would you be able to battle with them without a powerful instrument. So far this is the most expert app on the planet that uniquely plan to battle the house viably!  I saw numerous roulette strategies applications out there on the web, what\\s the distinction?  Answer: We created this application with the assistance from roulette gaming masters over the world. This is so far the most expert application and helpful device for roulette games. We have seven separate instruments particularly focusing on distinctive system players. For instance, our filter tool  is for outside bets players. Wheel tool with letter system is for straight bets players.  Do you have a client manual or instruction or forum discussion?  Answer: YES, we do. http://rool.tv   Why you folks supplant 00 with 99 on the screen?

It seems an eternity has passed since our last meeting. So I decided to write you a letter. Do you remember, when we were children, how often we were visiting various museums? It was museums of history, arts, science and technology. But we especially liked the art museums of fine arts. Were adding our own details to each painting, which we saw here. They came to life in our imagination, filled with mood, emotions and fantastic creatures. One time we saw how fire-breathing dragon fly over the wheat field and the peasants flee in the fear, another time we saw how curious mermaid peeking from the water to watch on sinking ship, and we saw how in the depths of a dark forest on the sunny meadow a faun plays on his magic flute, surrounded by group of goblins, fascinated by beautiful music... If only you would know, how I miss those times!   And now, after all those years, I have discovered an unusual museum. It presents a paintings of fantastic worlds, which we imagined when we was children. I look forward to our meeting and opportunity to show you all paintings. But there is one problem. These paintings are very old, time has left a deep trail on them. Thats why I need your help.   I understand your surprise! Im also not an artist and not an restorer. But we do not need to be them! In the basement of the museum I found the magic plate and a few tubes of paint. Thanks to them we will be able to restore the paintings piece by piece. And to do this we dont need to know, how to draw! Yes, my dear friend, all we need to do - is to transfer drops of paint in the correct order. And after restoration the painting come to life again, the picture finds its meaning and emotions, starts to play a wonderful music, and I am with you, as in the good old days, immersed in a world of our fantasies and dreams...   I beg you, go to the museum as soon as possible and help to restore all paintings. If you encounter any difficulty, remember - I left you detailed instructions in the letter.

Designed by award winning creators Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews, players control one of the two modern superpowers, as they work to spread their dominance throughout the world via political influence and coup attempts. But if either side triggers nuclear war, it\\s game over!  CARD BASED EVENTS   The event cards in the game are based on actual historical events from the Cold War era. Through the playing of these events, players exert their superpower\\s influence as they attempt to gain allies and regional control of the globe. From the early days of De-Stalinization, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War and beyond, players are immersed in the actual events of the struggle between these two nations to be the dominant superpower in the world!

Due to the demanding nature of the games trading algorithms and 3D environment, Merchants of Kaidan is not going to run on devices older than iPad 3 and iPhone 5. If you have such a device please DO NOT BUY THE GAME!  ****  Regain your riches, restore your honour and punish those who have wronged you.  Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high - a merchants motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.  A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability.  The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe youd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth. But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately? Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it costs next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they dont find anything?  These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.  - Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your fathers murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps. - A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more. - Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and youll get to manage 3 traders. - You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you short cuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost. - 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year. - Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business. - A set of artefacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events. - A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation.', Developer: 'Forever Entertainment S.A.', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 613326848, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/51%E5%86%9C%E5%9C%BA-%E6%A8%A1%E6%8B%9F%E7%BB%8F%E8%90%A5%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E6%89%8B%E6%B8%B8/id947299968', Name: '51\\u519c\\u573a-\\u6a21\\u62df\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u7b56\\u7565\\u624b\\u6e38', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple117/v4/a7/98/3d/a7983d09-9362-4d0f-fb4b-3445332f8177/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: '\\u300a51\\u519c\\u573a\\u300b\\u662f\\u4e00\\u6b3e\\u519c\\u573a\\u6a21\\u62df\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u7c7b\\u6e38\\u620f \\uff0c\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u5c06\\u5316\\u8eab\\u4e3a\\u4e00\\u540d\\u519c\\u573a\\u4e3b\\uff0c\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u79cd\\u690d\\u4f5c\\u7269\\uff0c\\u9972\\u517b\\u52a8\\u7269\\uff0c\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u519c\\u4f5c\\u7269\\u5546\\u54c1\\u6765\\u611f\\u53d7\\u519c\\u573a\\u7684\\u6b22\\u4e50\\u751f\\u6d3b\\u3002\\u5750\\u62e5\\u519c\\u573a\\u4e30\\u6536\\u4e4b\\u5999\\uff0c\\u8015\\u8018\\u5c5e\\u4e8e\\u4f60\\u4eec\\u81ea\\u5df1\\u7684\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u519c\\u573a\\u3002\\u53f2\\u4e0a\\u6700\\u771f\\u5b9e\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u6e38\\u620f\\uff0c\\u628a\\u519c\\u573a\\u4ea7\\u54c1\\u6253\\u5305\\u56de\\u5bb6\\uff0c\\u8ba9\\u865a\\u62df\\u4e0e\\u73b0\\u5b9e\\u5728\\u6b64\\u4ea4\\u878d\\uff01', Developer: '\\u638c\\u6e38\\u4fe1\\u606f\\u79d1\\u6280\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 155832320, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crash-bash/id947335595', Name: 'Crash Bash', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/c9/35/59/c93559fc-b6f0-845d-7574-6e888c03d872/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Super addictive Crash Bash free for everyone to play!
