Following Anglo-Saxon traditional sorcery you will learn to exercise your wiglung to anticipate and foresee how best to arrange the runes in order to optimize your weird (fate).  This game has puzzled the minds of many for hundreds of years.  Pit your wits against the fates and see if you are clever enough to solve the mysteries of the runes.\\n\\nIn the training version you will be able to undo moves and receive hints where to place runes.  Such actions erase all gains you have made.  Your score will reset as will any bonus accumulators you\\u2019ve earned.  So, use them wisely.  This version of the game is meant to allow you, at a cost, to explore various alternatives and teach you how to look ahead.  Taking in all the details that surround you and foreseeing probabilities and potential is the bread and butter of Anglo-Saxon sorcery.  Anglo-Sax sorcerers do not predict the future, they see the potential of all futures that could be and then choose and influence the one they want the most to occur.\\n\\nYou earn sorcery points by making 4 way connections.  These are the most difficult to make happen, however, fortune favors the lucky just the same.  Earn enough sorcery points with the classic game to unlock the Apprentice and Mastery versions.\\nGood luck young sorcerer.\\n\\nIt was believed that TOAG or Ishido was a means to divine the future.  A game of chance that also offered a glimpse of future events.  It teaches us that if we can perceive the possibilities before us we can better prepare for them in the future.  TOAG (Ishido) was a training tool for ancient prophets who sought to learn the timely craft of seeing into the future.\\n\\nTHE RULES\\nThere are 72 tiles, two of each combination of six colors and six icons. For example, there is 2 Red Feathers, 2 Blue Feathers, 2 Green Feathers, 2 White Feathers, 2 Purple Feathers, and 2 Yellow Feathers.  There are 5 other icons with the same color configuration making a total of 72 tiles.  At the start of the game six tiles are placed on the board automatically which are drawn from the bag of tiles after they have been shuffled.  To place an additional tile on the board, you must match at least one adjacent tile according to the restrictions listed below.  Each time you place a tile a random tile is drawn from the bag of tiles.  You play until either you can no longer place a tile on the board or you have emptied your bag of 72 tiles.\\n\\nTo match a single tile, you must match either the color or shape.\\n\\nTo match two tiles, you must match one shape and one color.\\n\\nTo match three tiles, you must match two colors and one shape OR two shapes and one color.\\n\\nTo match four tiles, you must match two colors and two shapes.\\n\\nWhen placing a tile you must consider those tiles which are adjacent to the location you want to place the tile at.  You can not place a tile on top of a tile.  If the space you want to place the tile at has 3 adjacent tiles you must match all three according to the restrictions listed above and so on.  As you get further along in the game placing tiles will become increasingly more difficult.  The strategy of the game is understanding how many colors of which tiles have already been drawn and which still remain in the bag.  By carefully placing key tiles on the board you can plan for the arrival of certain tiles to score greater points.  The more tiles you match with each placement of a tile the more points you will be awarded.\\n\\nTiles placed on the interior (lighter) squares score points when placed according to the number of adjacent tiles that they match.  Tiles placed outside the interior award no points (Traveling the interior of the board is a step of progress and risk, walking only at its perimeter is the safe mans journey which ultimately takes you in circles).","Developer":"Evan Schwartz","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":87687168,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitchy-thrones/id898649182","Name":"Twitchy Thrones","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/f5/9c/0b/f59c0bbc-4070-dc78-e66c-9c04ea05f59d/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Twitchy Thrones is a fast and fun strategy game with a medieval fantasy setting.\\n\\nBattle your way throughout the violent land of Lefteros!

The strategy game features unique hand drawn map, complex morale, innovative controls and smart AI. \\n\\nUltimate general: Gettysburg is a critically acclaimed indie wargame with one of the highest user ratings for strategy games on Steam and Metacritic. \\n\\n\\nKEY FEATURES\\n==============\\n\\n**Campaign\\nThe campaign is split into 10 historical missions from the first engagements to the famous \\u201cPickett\\u2019s charge\\u201d. Missions present different levels of complexity that will give you hours of gameplay. \\n\\n**Unique Controls & Unit Self-Awareness\\nThe game plays in real time, but you can pause at any time to plan your strategy and give orders to units. Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces as if you are drawing them on the tactical map. Units do not need micromanagement, able to act on their own: re-aligning, switching targets, withdrawing and forming battle lines without player input.\\n\\n**Smart AI \\nThe AI commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting to your actions; fighting aggressively or defensively replicating actions of a competent human player. The game will provide the significant challenge on higher difficulty levels.\\n\\n**Detailed Map of Gettysburg\\nWe used satellite images and historical maps, recreating important locations, houses, ridges and hills that are depicted as accurately as possible within the game\\u2019s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, but also you will be able to use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game.\\n \\n**Advanced Line of Sight\\nElevation and obstructions will affect unit visibility realistically. Units will use concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware \\u2013 the AI will attempt to do the same. \\n \\n**Tactics matter\\nIn Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not \\u201cmachines\\u201d that blindly follow orders, but need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected from a strategy game is important for winning battles. Unite morale is affected by multiple factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue.\\n \\n**Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders\\nUltimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Command famous brigades like the Iron Brigade, Louisiana Tigers, 1st Vermont, Bucktail Brigade, Gibraltar Brigade, Excelsior Brigade and many more.\\n\\n**Differences with the PC version\\nThe game was redesigned from the ground up to provide good usability and playability on tablets. If you have played the game on the PC, the major change is in the campaign flow and in the user interface. The tactical combat and its features were tuned only slightly. You will be able to experience the same depth and challenge on iPad. \\n\\nRetina display ready","Developer":"Game Labs LLC","Age_Rating":"9+","Size":293021696,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-sokobang/id913616076","Name":"Super Sokobang","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/88/d3/25/88d3257d-3395-16a0-78a6-d8b899e1e4b6/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Here is Super Sokobang, a game that, although its simple rules, will really challenge your brains!

What if 2016 had gone differently, if perhaps your candidate had had a bit more money, been a better candidate, or just been a bit luckier? What if someone else had run? What if a third party candidate had just as much money to spend? Or maybe even significantly more? What could you do with a hundred million dollars? A billion? Ten billion? What if there were four competitive parties? How would that change things? What if there were no established parties running at all?\\n\\nWith Election Manager 2016 you can answer those questions and more... Try running an election on a shoestring or with an unfair advantage. Run as a Democrat or Republican, manage the Libertarian or Green ticket, or go completely independent. Let your adviser make all your decisions for you, or micromanage every decision yourself, or anything in-between. The choices are all up to you.\\n\\nAbout the Game:\\n\\nElection Manager 2016 is an abstract strategic election simulation game where you manage your ticket in an attempt to get your candidate elected to the office of President of the United States. Election Manager comes with a variety of scenarios, from a recreation of the 2012 election to a four-way election between independent parties. In addition, almost any imaginable two-to-four way election scenario can be designed by the player.\\n\\nThe Election Manager 2016 engine uses actual historical and demographic data to produce reasonable election results, taking into account factors such as partisan lean and voter elasticity. The player will not only have to consider states but also media markets, giving the game a strategic dimension due the inefficient mapping from one to the other. For instance, to target New Jerseys 14 electoral votes, the player would have to spend money on ads in the Philadelphia or New York City markets \\u2014 but significant portions of those markets are actually in other states. So is it really worth spending that money there, or would it be better spent going after other states instead?\\n\\nWhile Election Manager aims to give you complete control of your strategy, it also comes with tools to help you manage it \\u2014 up to and including an AI campaign manager to which you can delegate any part (or all) of your strategy, from campaign stops to ad buys to state offices to polling. Game features include:\\n\\n\\u2022 Completely customizable scenarios, including pre-built 2012 and hypothetical 2016 scenarios\\n\\u2022 Scenarios for two to four parties\\n\\u2022 Run a Democratic ticket, a Republican ticket, or any number of third-party or independent tickets\\n\\u2022 Single player or hotseat multiplayer\\n\\u2022 Set up campaign and fundraising stops for your candidate\\n\\u2022 Plan your ad strategy for every market in the United States\\n\\u2022 Use ads to attack your opponent, or boost your campaign with positive ads\\n\\u2022 Set up campaign offices in battleground states\\n\\u2022 Handle everything yourself, delegate everything to your AI campaign advisor, or anything in-between\\n\\u2022 Tools to help you plan your polling or ad campaigns or budgeting\\n\\u2022 Data and maps and lots of it","Developer":"Lensflare Games LLC","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":63550464,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tictactoe-black/id923822483","Name":"TicTacToe black","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/61/f8/c8/61f8c8d5-dc9e-7af7-0360-912fc246211c/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Simple tic tac toe game with Blackboard-like graphic and sounds.","Developer":"Luca Naddei","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":7487488,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storage-empire-pawn-wars/id923822987","Name":"Storage Empire: Pawn Wars","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/92/aa/c5/92aac558-02e9-ccda-df18-6dbc09a6deef/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Storage Empire - the 1st free auction game with multiplayer and life-like items to win. \\nGarage sale or pawn stars fans remember: bid at auctions if the price is right! \\n\\nBid for items at storage auctions and sell them for profit at your own retail store.

Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that\\u2019s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\\n\\nYoull need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until theyre baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where youll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\\n\\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, youll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\\n\\n** NEW FOR PAPAS PIZZERIA TO GO **\\n\\nPapas Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers dont get in the way of the action!\\n\\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - Youll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\\n\\nTOPPING STATION - Weve completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You dont need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\\n\\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louies coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and youll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\\n\\nCUTTING STATION - When its time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If youre having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\\n\\nNEW INGREDIENTS - Weve added a ton of new ingredients which cant be found in the original Papas Pizzeria.  As you play the game, youll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\\n\\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!

The Cambodian transitive verb \\u201cRek\\u201d means \\u2018carry on one\\u2019s shoulder a pole at each end of which is a container, bundle or object. It was pointed out that the game was popular among military troops. Today, it is also played by Cambodian women.\\n\\nObjective\\nThe object of the game is to \\u201ccapture\\u201d instead of checkmate the opponent\\u2019s King. All units may be captured in two ways :\\n\\n   1- when they are \\u201cRek\\u201d by an enemy unit in the analogy that they are the containers carried away by that enemy unit. This later way of capture actually bears the name of the game.\\n\\n   2- when they are tightly surrounded or trapped by the enemy units and thus have no legal move.\\n\\nIt also has two different forces of 32 units in total . Each side starts with a force of 16 units: One King and 15 Men. All the Men have the same value and physical shape. And they all, including the Kings, move like the Boat or Rook.\\n\\nAnother Style of Play\\u200b (Taunt enemry to Rek)\\nThe Rek also has its own special style of play. It is named \\u201cMin Rek Chanh\\u201d (Not Rek Lose if opponent taunt). The object of the game is still the same, capturing the opponent\\u2019s King. But, there is only one legal way to capture the enemy units, including the King: \\u201cRek\\u201d them two at a time.\\n\\nThe Kings may not move at all, not even a square. They are \\u201cpalace kings\\u201d! Other setting features and opening setup are the same as those of the regular Rek. The unique characteristic of this style of play is that a player\\u2019s order of Rek to the other must be honored, otherwise the latter loses and the game is over. So, strategic and deliberate sacrifices are the mind set behind winning the game.\\n\\nUsually the game is over when one player orders a \\u201cright\\u201d series of the opponent\\u2019s consecutive moves to \\u2018Rek\\u2019 his units which ultimately will lead to the capture or Rek of the opponent\\u2019s King in return. BUT, if he orders the wrong series of the opponent\\u2019s moves, he ends up losing his force without any desirable consequence. Thus the game demands a long-term and coherent strategic planning to get the right orders of move.\\n\\nIn this kind of play, you are in a more dangerous situation for preserving too many own units, but if you do not have enough of them to design your scheme of making a right series of the opponent\\u2019s moves, it is not good either.","Developer":"Nora Ky","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":49222656,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/conquer-city-wars/id928421527","Name":"Conquer City Wars","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/e6/ba/7d/e6ba7d75-5757-2683-cfe2-18efed64804a/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"\\u611f\\u53d7\\u4e09\\u56fd\\u82f1\\u96c4\\u500d\\u51fa\\u7684\\u65f6\\u4ee3\\uff0c\\u4f53\\u9a8c\\u6307\\u6325\\u5343\\u519b\\u4e07\\u9a6c\\u6740\\u654c\\u7684\\u5feb\\u611f\\uff0c\\u9886\\u7565\\u541b\\u4e3b\\u9010\\u9e7f\\u4e2d\\u539f\\u3001\\u7edf\\u4e00\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u7684\\u6c14\\u9b44\\uff0c\\u5218\\u5907\\u3001\\u66f9\\u64cd\\u3001\\u5b59\\u6743\\u90fd\\u5c06\\u7531\\u4f60\\u628a\\u63a7\\uff0c\\u5728\\u4f60\\u7684\\u91d1\\u6208\\u94c1\\u8e44\\u4e0b\\u8d62\\u4e86\\u5929\\u4e0b\\uff01\\n\\nFeatures:\\n-\\u653b\\u57ce\\u6218\\u3001\\u906d\\u9047\\u6218\\u3001\\u5b88\\u57ce\\u6218\\uff0c\\u5404\\u79cd\\u771f\\u5b9e\\u6218\\u4e89\\u4f53\\u9a8c\\n-\\u6218\\u6597\\u4e2d\\u70b9\\u51fb\\u7206\\u53d1\\u53ef\\u4f7f\\u82f1\\u96c4\\u65e0\\u9650\\u4f53\\u80fd\\u3001\\u653b\\u51fb\\u529b\\u5927\\u589e\\uff0c\\u52a9\\u4f60\\u653b\\u514b\\u5f3a\\u654c\\uff01\\n-\\u5360\\u9886\\u5168\\u90e8\\u57ce\\u5e02\\uff0c\\u5373\\u53ef\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7edf\\u4e00\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u7684\\u7f8e\\u68a6\\uff01\\n-\\u51fb\\u8d25\\u7684\\u4fd8\\u864f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u529d\\u964d\\u52a0\\u5165\\u4f60\\u65b9\\uff0c\\u52a9\\u4f60\\u5b8c\\u6210\\u7edf\\u4e00\\u5927\\u4e1a\\uff01\\n-\\u8fdb\\u5ea6\\u5b58\\u6863\\uff0c\\u4fdd\\u5b58\\u4efb\\u4f55\\u5e74\\u4ee3\\u7684\\u6218\\u4e89\\u548c\\u82f1\\u96c4\\u72b6\\u6001\\uff0c\\u968f\\u65f6\\u7a7f\\u8d8a\\u56de\\u53bb\\u3002\\n-\\u7eaf\\u51c0\\u6d41\\u7545\\u7684\\u6e38\\u620f\\u4f53\\u9a8c!","Developer":"Chuanli Gan","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":232550400,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tempra/id928533123","Name":"Tempra","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/3c/11/32/3c11327d-9a5c-fe3b-093d-43f40475d2d5/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Test and increase the accuracy and precision of your sense of time.\\n\\nFor each trial, your goal is to get as close as possible to the displayed target time. \\n\\nBreathe... relax, and focus on your internal sense of time.\\n\\nDesigned and built by Che-Wei Wang\\nMIT Media Lab, Playful Systems","Developer":"CW&T","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":5701632,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fast-move-laser/id928796015","Name":"Fast Move Laser","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/5a/53/e2/5a53e2d7-f54a-f6e7-4ccf-29281618d943/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Move fast or get left behind\\n\\nThe goal is to avoid collision between goal and the okto. each okto has one side that is open.

Cards can not be drawn if there is an empty column, every column must have at least one card in there to be able to draw from the deck.

Movement is based on a tile system, each turn the player can move to any adjacent tile, and the vampire hunters also move one tile. The catch is that the vampire hunters have torches and flashlights, and can see ahead. If the vampire is caught in the hunter\\s line-of-sight, all the hunters in the neighborhood will converge and attempt to corner the vampire, resulting in death.\\n\\nAdam Smith http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/27/lamp-and-vamp-is-the-best-free-game/  \\nIt\\s a puzzle game in which you play a vampire who is trying to return to his coffin.

The ball will only flash twice.  The first flash happens when the ball drops and the second flash happens on the line. You\\u2019re goal is to tap the screen when you think the ball will appear in the orange target area.\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo can famously volley a corner kick in total darkness. The magic behind this remarkable feat is hidden in Cristiano\\u2019s brain which enables him to use advance cues to plan upcoming actions. Darkball challenges your brain to do the same, distilling that scenario into its simplest form - intercept a ball in the dark. All you see is all you need.\\n\\nOne of the brain\\u2019s fundamental functions is to use information from the past and present to predict the future. This function is key to how animals, from dragonflies to humans, navigate a dynamic and uncertain world. To make predictions, the brain must have an \\u201cinternal model\\u201d of the system it interacts with. A basic form of this function is at play when we move our body. For example, to reach for a cup, the brain must have a model to predict how the hand would respond to various motor commands. Internal models are also thought to play a crucial role when we mentally predict future states of the environment, for example when we track a ball as it moves behind another object. Here, we have designed a simple task to understand how the nervous system makes such predictions. In this task, subjects have to intercept a ball when it reaches its final position. By changing the speed of the ball, the intervals when it is invisible, and the target position, we will test various hypotheses about the algorithms that are used to integrate information about past and present to make predictions about future.","Developer":"CW&T","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":3293184,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rool-for-american-roulette/id937466288","Name":"ROOL for American Roulette","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/35/c2/a9/35c2a905-7dac-f8d2-1a05-c9f8badaf1bd/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"American roulette is unique.

The movements of the roulette wheel are unsurprising, and figuring out the equation that dictates where the ball is going to land is more than possible if you have the aid of a computer. Obviously, you don\\t need to look at the air resistance and friction of the ball and the wheel. What you have to do is take a gander at all is the information we gave you and figured out the most hit regions. Spotlight on that territory, and you\\ll win.\\n\\nWhy would it be a good idea for you to download this application? \\nAnswer: House does undermine you, every one of those machines are situated up to TAKE your cash and not to provide for you any,  by what means would you be able to battle with them without a powerful instrument. So far this is the most expert app on the planet that uniquely plan to battle the house viably!\\n\\nI saw numerous roulette strategies applications out there on the web, what\\s the distinction? \\nAnswer: We created this application with the assistance from roulette gaming masters over the world. This is so far the most expert application and helpful device for roulette games. We have seven separate instruments particularly focusing on distinctive system players. For instance, our filter tool  is for outside bets players. Wheel tool with letter system is for straight bets players.\\n\\nDo you have a client manual or instruction or forum discussion? \\nAnswer: YES, we do. http://rool.tv \\n\\nWhy you folks supplant 00 with 99 on the screen? \\nSince 00 is the same than some other numbers on the wheel so that you won\\t get confused by the idea of two zero.\\n\\n#Ladbrokes  #William Hill  #Luckylivecasino\\n\\n*we got the report that OS.X.10.7 cannot open the application properly, at times it\\s a blank screen.

So I decided to write you a letter. Do you remember, when we were children, how often we were visiting various museums? It was museums of history, arts, science and technology. But we especially liked the art museums of fine arts. Were adding our own details to each painting, which we saw here. They came to life in our imagination, filled with mood, emotions and fantastic creatures. One time we saw how fire-breathing dragon fly over the wheat field and the peasants flee in the fear, another time we saw how curious mermaid peeking from the water to watch on sinking ship, and we saw how in the depths of a dark forest on the sunny meadow a faun plays on his magic flute, surrounded by group of goblins, fascinated by beautiful music... If only you would know, how I miss those times!\\n \\nAnd now, after all those years, I have discovered an unusual museum. It presents a paintings of fantastic worlds, which we imagined when we was children. I look forward to our meeting and opportunity to show you all paintings. But there is one problem. These paintings are very old, time has left a deep trail on them. Thats why I need your help.\\n \\nI understand your surprise! Im also not an artist and not an restorer. But we do not need to be them! In the basement of the museum I found the magic plate and a few tubes of paint. Thanks to them we will be able to restore the paintings piece by piece. And to do this we dont need to know, how to draw! Yes, my dear friend, all we need to do - is to transfer drops of paint in the correct order. And after restoration the painting come to life again, the picture finds its meaning and emotions, starts to play a wonderful music, and I am with you, as in the good old days, immersed in a world of our fantasies and dreams...\\n \\nI beg you, go to the museum as soon as possible and help to restore all paintings. If you encounter any difficulty, remember - I left you detailed instructions in the letter. You can always read it here:\\nhttp://colorworlds.com/index.php/en/game.html\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\nfriend, who never tires to believe in miracles.\\n\\n\\n\\nATTENTION!!!

What if Chiang\\s forces had held on in southern China? What if Churchill\\s Tories had won re-election in 1945? And what if the Western Allies had crossed the bridge too far, and reached Berlin first? These and other possibilities that alter the opening setup in Twilight Struggle are now open to players. Both seasoned veterans and new arrivals will enjoy the many new plays and dilemmas introduced here for the first time.

But if either side triggers nuclear war, it\\s game over!\\n\\nCARD BASED EVENTS  \\nThe event cards in the game are based on actual historical events from the Cold War era. Through the playing of these events, players exert their superpower\\s influence as they attempt to gain allies and regional control of the globe. From the early days of De-Stalinization, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War and beyond, players are immersed in the actual events of the struggle between these two nations to be the dominant superpower in the world!\\n\\nIMMERSIVE STRATEGY \\nHone your skill and strategy as a world leader against an A.I. opponent, and then take your game global with matches against other players via asynchronous online game play. \\n\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\u2022A.I.

Due to the demanding nature of the games trading algorithms and 3D environment, Merchants of Kaidan is not going to run on devices older than iPad 3 and iPhone 5. If you have such a device please DO NOT BUY THE GAME!\\n\\n****\\n\\nRegain your riches, restore your honour and punish those who have wronged you.\\n\\nMerchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high - a merchants motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.\\n\\nA good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability.\\n\\nThe conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe youd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.\\nBut is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?\\nOr is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it costs next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they dont find anything?\\n\\nThese are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.\\n\\n- Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your fathers murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps.\\n- A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more.\\n- Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and youll get to manage 3 traders.\\n- You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you short cuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost.\\n- 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year.\\n- Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business.\\n- A set of artefacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events.\\n- A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation.","Developer":"Forever Entertainment S.A.","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":613326848,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/51%E5%86%9C%E5%9C%BA-%E6%A8%A1%E6%8B%9F%E7%BB%8F%E8%90%A5%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E6%89%8B%E6%B8%B8/id947299968","Name":"51\\u519c\\u573a-\\u6a21\\u62df\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u7b56\\u7565\\u624b\\u6e38","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple117/v4/a7/98/3d/a7983d09-9362-4d0f-fb4b-3445332f8177/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"\\u300a51\\u519c\\u573a\\u300b\\u662f\\u4e00\\u6b3e\\u519c\\u573a\\u6a21\\u62df\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u7c7b\\u6e38\\u620f \\uff0c\\u5728\\u8fd9\\u91cc\\uff0c\\u60a8\\u5c06\\u5316\\u8eab\\u4e3a\\u4e00\\u540d\\u519c\\u573a\\u4e3b\\uff0c\\u901a\\u8fc7\\u79cd\\u690d\\u4f5c\\u7269\\uff0c\\u9972\\u517b\\u52a8\\u7269\\uff0c\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u519c\\u4f5c\\u7269\\u5546\\u54c1\\u6765\\u611f\\u53d7\\u519c\\u573a\\u7684\\u6b22\\u4e50\\u751f\\u6d3b\\u3002\\u5750\\u62e5\\u519c\\u573a\\u4e30\\u6536\\u4e4b\\u5999\\uff0c\\u8015\\u8018\\u5c5e\\u4e8e\\u4f60\\u4eec\\u81ea\\u5df1\\u7684\\u4e2a\\u6027\\u519c\\u573a\\u3002\\u53f2\\u4e0a\\u6700\\u771f\\u5b9e\\u7ecf\\u8425\\u6e38\\u620f\\uff0c\\u628a\\u519c\\u573a\\u4ea7\\u54c1\\u6253\\u5305\\u56de\\u5bb6\\uff0c\\u8ba9\\u865a\\u62df\\u4e0e\\u73b0\\u5b9e\\u5728\\u6b64\\u4ea4\\u878d\\uff01","Developer":"\\u638c\\u6e38\\u4fe1\\u606f\\u79d1\\u6280\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":155832320,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crash-bash/id947335595","Name":"Crash Bash","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/c9/35/59/c93559fc-b6f0-845d-7574-6e888c03d872/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Super addictive Crash Bash free for everyone to play!\\n\\nTap the screen and avoid getting bashed \\n\\nCompete with players all over the world and get your name on the highscore!\\n\\nSuitable for all ages","Developer":"Ambrella Media","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":10104832,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/star-puzzle-untangled/id947343559","Name":"Star Puzzle Untangled","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/37/09/26/370926da-e01a-b3e9-5e00-80ee82de5806/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Completely free to play!\\n\\nStar puzzle untangled is a simple, relaxing puzzle game.
