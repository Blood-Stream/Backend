It is played on 3 square minefields stacked one on top of another.  \\n\\nMines are hidden under some of the squares on the minefields.  You must uncover as many squares as possible but not uncover any of the squares that are hiding a mine.  An uncovered square reveals the number of mines that are adjacent to it.  An uncovered square is considered adjacent to all of the squares around it that are on its level and also the squares, if any, above and below both itself and also those adjacent squares on its level.  For example, an uncovered square in the center of the middle level, is adjacent to 8 squares on its level, 9 squares on the top level and 9 squares on the bottom level.  An uncovered square in a corner of the top level, is adjacent to 3 squares on the top level, 4 squares on the middle level and 0 squares on the bottom level.   \\n\\n*  A 3D logic puzzle more complex than the original, 2D, single level MineSweeper\\n*  Free unlimited minefields for 11 different combinations of size and mine density\\n*  4 different sizes (3x3x3, 4x4x3, 5x5x3, 6x6x3)\\n*  5 different mine densities (4%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% - not all densities available for all sizes)\\n*  In App Purchase upgrade adds 4 more sizes (7x7x3, 8x8x3, 9x9x3 and 10x10x3) and includes all 5 mine densities for each size - an additional 29 different combinations of size and mine density.  \\n*  Best scores saved and posted on the Game Center \\n\\n[The reason why 3 Level MineSweeper is a complex logic puzzle (and not a random luck, speed game) is based on the observation that if one uncovered square (A) is adjacent to another uncovered square (B), and all of the squares adjacent to A are also adjacent to B, then the number of mines that are adjacent to B but not adjacent to A is the number revealed on B minus the number revealed on A.  A simple application of this general observation is that if A is on the top level and B is on the middle level precisely below A then the number of mines that will be on the bottom level adjacent to B will be the number revealed on B minus the number revealed on A.  Other more complex applications of this general observation can be used to solve most minefields.  We have found that most minefields, other than minefields with a mine density of 20%, can be solved with only the second and third move being a guess with, at times, an additional 2-1-2 ambiguity at the very end (i.e. a sequence of 2 squares, one of which contains a mine, 1 uncovered square, and then 2 squares, 1 of which contains a mine).]\\n\\nShown below:\\n1) A 5x5x3 minefield after the first move.\\n2) The same minefield having been solved using multiple applications of the observation above.\\n3) The Select table showing best scores for minefields\\n4) A 3x3x3 minefield being solved.  The mine marker indicates that a mine must be under the square and the color markers indicate that one mine is hidden under each set of colored squares. \\n5) A 4x4x3 minefield being solved.","Developer":"Peter Kramer","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":3641344,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starburst-crazy-pop-stars-mania/id780687911","Name":"Starburst - Crazy Pop Stars Mania","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/57/42/37/574237e2-ac2b-d8d9-b9ec-0a573b2e8399/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Looking for a highly addictive and challenging fun game?

Even the simplest inferencing can be difficult for some children. Children begin to make observations when they can see something happening. In contrast, inferences are what they figure out based on an experience or relating to an experience, which is more abstract. Helping students understand when information is implied, or not directly stated, will improve their skills in drawing conclusions, making inferences/predictions, reasoning, problem solving, logic, critical thinking, cognitive skills and even social skills. Special needs students can benefit greatly from gaining inferencing abilities in this motivating format which provides the building blocks for more difficult inferencing.\\n\\nThese skills will be needed for all types of school assignments, including reading, science, social studies and many other subjects, as well as life in general. Inferential thinking is a complex skill that will develop over time and with experience. Questions may ask why a person may have responded as he did or what the child thinks will happen next. Because young children are quite literal, this is often very difficult and they have to \\u201cread between the lines.\\u201d\\n\\nQuestions are presented in a game format, giving the student the opportunity to choose the best answer, that would make the most logical sense, given the details provided. It will help students read into important situations in their future, simply by developing and expanding these important skills. Teachers, parents and therapists can use these for critical thinking discussion questions, rational thought, and common sense predictions. Some topics touch on common social skill scenarios. \\n \\nFEATURES: \\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\u2022 Over 100+ questions in random order\\n\\u2022 Answers are not directly stated in the question, so the user must use critical thinking abilities \\n\\u2022 Motivationally animated voice feedback after responses for encouragement \\n\\u2022 Brainy Bonus after every 5 correct questions offer a chance to take the challenge and earn a higher score\\n\\u2022 Classrooms with multiple iPads can set up Brainy Skills timed contests, to encourage friendly competition while building these important skills\\n\\u2022 Adjustable timer: 15, 30, 45, & 60 second settings\\n\\u2022 Mixed skills levels\\n\\u2022 No in app purchases as well as no distracting advertising allowing complete concentration for the user\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHelps players improve reading comprehension skills while building confidence to score high! \\n \\nTry Brainy Skills Inferencing Game","Developer":"A Brainy Choice, Inc.","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":14464000,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/connexio/id787696920","Name":"Connexio","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/43/4e/95/434e9553-6a99-0cd0-3b74-8023095b8b9a/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Connexio is the addictingly challenging Sliding Puzzle game designed for iOS.

Become a public transport tycoon and enjoy this nontraditional strategy and time management game. Play through the history from 1960 up to 2020, buy many of different trams, upgrade the stations and find the best strategy to achieve all trophies in time.\\n\\nCitizens expect comfort trams and this is important - do not let them order a taxi! Each tram offers specific number of capacity, price and XP points for each transported passenger. City is changing each level so you will need your brain. Be a smart director and organize your pocket tram imperium wisely. \\n\\nTired of tons of confusing tables during growing your virtual business yet? This simulator is really easy to control, tutorial is short and clever so you will enjoy the challenge in the first early moments. Then compare trophies you have achieved with other Game Center players and try to get more than 20 achievements. \\n\\nTime is running... wake up the drivers, turn on the lights in your trains and put them on the railway! Get this sweet and addictive game and transport them all!\\n\\nENGLISH STRATEGY TIPS:\\n- UNDERSTANDING THE CITY\\nFrom the very first moment of the level you should watch the buildings! The taller building you are looking at, the bigger potential it has! Taller buildings offer more passengers. So your first tram line should be going through these huge buildings!\\n\\n- PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING\\nCitizens want to be transported! Anyhow. If there is no line created by your company, they will choose a taxi. And this is the point! Each passenger gives you the XP you need for the trophies and winning each level! Taxi on the board means you have lost 20 passengers! A lot of XP! Like the previous paragraph said: a bigger building equals more passengers.\\n\\n- XP UNDERSTANDING\\nEach tram gives you a specific number of XP for each transported passenger. Think about it, deeply. When you buy a tram with 7 XP and you loose 20 passengers (1 person on the board), it means 140 XP. Try not to lose too much XP.\\n\\n- CHOOSING CORRECT STARTING LINE\\nAs stated you should explore the city at the beginning. Start your first line on the place where there are a lot of bigger buildings! Bigger buildings mean a lot of potencial lost passengers (stolen by the taxi). This is really important to think about!\\n\\n- CHOOSING CORRECT VEHICLE\\nAre you purchasing the trams without thinking about their price and capacity? This is crucial. XP is not everything in the very first moments! You have probably bought the best possible tram at the beginning (because you want as much XP as possible) but your station capacity is only 20 passengers (without upgrades). This is the issue! A tram with huge capacity is useless when you don\\xb4t upgrade the stations (it serves 20 more people per each upgrade). So where is the point? You will be doing well with tram with small capacity and price at the beginning. Small XP earnings are not important in the beginning! First of all you need money for better trams in the near future! You can earn a lot of money with cheaper trams in the beginning! That\\xb4s why cash is important! Buy better trams after some time. Expensive trams with huge capacity make sense only if you can serve a bigger number of passengers at the stations! Always think about the ratio between the capacity of a station and the capacity of a tram! A wrong strategy can consupt your money and then your XP by the taxis!\\n\\n- UPGRADING THE STATIONS\\nThis paragraph is linked to previous. Imagine you have bought a tram with a small capacity. So there is no sense to upgrade the stations to their maximum while you are saving money for better trams! Station upgrades are expensive! Upgrade the stations after buying a new tram. Immediately, if possible.","Developer":"Daniel Viktorin","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":22437888,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-chess/id788602889","Name":"Remote Chess","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/de/41/a9/de41a9be-f90e-51f2-e5c2-54c77066b8e1/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"This is the classic Chess game, designed to be played by two remote players, using two network connected iPads.

Board fulfilled with ancient symbols appears in each level. The symbol shapes are from the Inscriptions of ancient China, which were only permitted to be used by the royal family at that time. At the beginning there are five kinds of symbols(East, South, West, North, Center).\\n\\nThe basic move of this game is horizontally or vertically swapping the positions of two adjacent symbols, to create sets of three (or more) symbols of the same shape. Each level contains a certain objective that must be completed in a given number of moves reaching a certain score.\\n\\nWhen a compass combination (west symbol to the left, east to the right, north to the upper, south to the below, center to the middle) is formed, the west symbol and east symbol are turned into gold symbols (which removes all symbols with the same shape of the one it is matched with) and the rest 3 symbols get removed with explosion effect.\\n\\nDifferent special symbols can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or more than 5 of the same shape in a horizontally or vertically line, a striped symbol (which clears either an entire row or column), or a gold symbol. Special symbols can also be matched together. Matching a gold symbol with a striped symbol turns all of the symbols of its shape into striped symbols, which are immediately detonated. Matching two gold symbols will remove all the symbols on the board.

We discovered it at the famous USATE Tournament, brought it home, and it has become a favorite game at home, and among chess fans at our local chess club\\u2026.\\u201d\\n\\n2)  Becca, 12 year old student writes\\u2026\\n\\u201cMy family and i love plunderchess!! it is the best ever!! we\e always playing it! I used 2 dread it when my family played chess bc 2 me it was boring. but PLUNDERchess, now thats another story. its easy to understand and FUN!\\u201d\\n\\nHere are a few of the BASIC Rules of PlunderChess\\xae Play:\\n1) Plundering occurs when a chess piece captures an opposing piece and plunders or acquires additional moving capabilities directly from the piece it just captured, hence, strengthening the capturing piece!  This plundering is illustrated by the overlaying of a colored banner (called vests) on the piece that made the capture.  Image illustrations provided.\\n\\n2) The added moving capability provided by a plundered vest may be used one time only on any future move.  (I.e., the plundered vest may be used on it\\s very next move or carried around on the board and used later in the game, but only once.)\\n\\n3) Plundering is optional and may be declined by the player making the capture.  YES, sometimes you do NOT want to plunder a vest from the spoils of the kill!!  The case for NOT plundering would be if you suspect your opponent will immediately capture you back (making a trade) and acquire the vest you just plundered!  (See rule #9)\\n\\n4) When plundering is elected, a colored vest banner that corresponds to the moving capabilities being plundered, gets overlaid upon the chess piece that made the kill.  This vest banner signifies to both players that the piece wearing it now has extra moving capabilities for one future move.","Developer":"White Horse Games, LLC","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":29162496,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/veggie-smash-mania/id793999055","Name":"Veggie Smash Mania","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/9c/74/c9/9c74c9e7-d101-8214-dd6c-a3ebab4d0975/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Simple - Fun - Addictive - this is one game that youll want to keep coming back to!\\n\\nFun for all ages!

Vulnerable Wizard and Druid deal most damage, but require protection.\\n\\n\\n+ Never Ending Battle\\n\\nUnlike traditional grid based games, like Heroes of Might and Magic series, Tactical RPG\\s turn based battle never ends - new enemies appear from the right side of the map each turn. Your goal is to push them back using any menas\\n\\n\\n+ New Combat Mechanics\\n\\nThe game is focused around the concept of Blood Magic - dealing damage to your enemies replenishes the party\\s shared energy pool. You can then use this energy to boost your character stats or unleash devastating abilities on your enemies. \\n\\n\\n+ In-Depth Stats and Level System\\n\\nAs you defeat enemies, you will earn xp to level up your heroes, increasing their stats and learning new skills. There are 5 stats, that affect your characters health and stamina. Getting tired in the middle of a fight makes your heroes a lot less effective.\\n\\n\\n\\n+ 80 items to equip\\n\\nTactical RPG for iPad offers a lot of freedom in how to gear up your characters. There are over 40 types of light, medium and heavy armor and over 40 weapons, ranging from simple clubs to deadly two handed swords. Most equipment can be upgraded, and magical equipment is available.\\n\\n\\n+ Brutal Difficulty\\n\\nNew enemies join battle every turn, and it is your duty to use strategy and tactics to push them back without being overwhelmed. You can Conquer land and shift the map right by one column. This reveals new terrain to fight on, new treasures and new traps.\\n\\n\\n+ Tactical Terrain\\n\\nDifferent kinds of terrain help or hinder units. Hills let you shoot further. Lava burns everyone and swamps boost your magic output. Terrain has different move costs and can act as an effective barrier against enemies. Making terrain a part of your strategy is a key to victory.\\n\\n\\n+ 40 skills to master\\n\\nHeroes of Blood Magic for iPad has healing, damage, summoning, terrain manipulation and crowd control skills for every tactical occasion. Using the upkeep system, you can have your buffs active for as long as you spend energy to maintain them. \\n\\n\\n+ A work in progress\\n\\nBuilt by a single developer on a limited budget, this game does not have fancy graphics, animations or sound. Instead, the emphasis is on gameplay and seeing how long you can survive against overwhelming numbers of enemies. If the game becomes popular, I will create a kickstarter campaign to pay for animations and  music.\\n\\n+ FREE !\\nThis game is completely FREE. No hidden fees to unlock content, no limits on progression. The only in app purchase you can get is buying extra energy for use by your characters.","Developer":"Alexander Stone","Age_Rating":"9+","Size":32497664,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fish-tank-frenzy/id798506654","Name":"Fish Tank Frenzy","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/2e/b6/09/2eb6090f-0198-6d4f-4c63-b6b3bdf0f32e/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Want to get the valuable pearls from the deep seas?\\n\\nYou can take them but you will have to fight to get them!\\n\\nYes, fight with the sea fish who are around the pearls.\\n\\nThe crazy fish will attack you when you will try to take the pearls!\\n\\nKill the fish using your magical weapons!

You can remove tiles by moving over numbers that have a common factor and then tapping the selection. \\n\\nAs long as you don\\t lift your finger you can select as much numbers as you like. You can easily select groups of two or more tiles that are connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If you want to clear the selection just tap outside the selection.\\n\\nWhen you remove a group, any tiles above them fall down to fill the gaps. The more tiles you remove in one tap, the more you score. In general, removing N tiles in one tap scores N x [greatest common factor] points.\\n\\nBut watch out: sometimes you get more points if you remove tiles in separate groups that have bigger factors. If you select the numbers 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 30  in one stroke you get 6 x 2 = 12 points. You better remove the numbers 2, 4, 6 and 10, 20, 30 in two strokes: 2,4,6 give 3x2 points, 10,20,30 give 3x10 points, together 36 points!\\n \\nThe red tiles are prime numbers, which are mixed in as an obstacle. If you try to remove a prime number together with a normal number you will loose 50 points. Ditto if not all selected numbers have a common factor.\\n\\nAs a special bonus you get 10 points for each red tile if you succeed in removing 6 or more primes in a row or column (sorry, no diagonals allowed).\\n\\n\\nYou can choose from 3 game modes:\\n\\nIn Until no move left mode you can remove tiles as long as there are matching tiles left. \\n\\nIn Endless mode the board will be filled with new tiles as soon as tiles are removed. You can play for ever.\\n\\nThe field in the 1-minute-sprint looses its floor after 60 seconds. How many points you can get under time pressure?\\n\\nFor each of the different games there are separate highscores, where you can see your progress in training the time tables or compare your score against other players. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is is good for?\\n\\nKids learn the best when they play a game. To reach a high score in the Same 1x1 Game they have to know their times tables. Otherwise they miss the big point boosters like 27,81 (adds 2*27=54 points) or 14,56,70 ( adds 3*14=52 points).

Chess Game, developed by http://www.znappy.com/ is now available on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad!\\n\\nOne of the most popular games, Chess Game is considered to be the greatest strategy game of all time. The origins of chess are not exactly clear, though most believe it evolved from earlier chess-like games played in India almost two thousand years ago. The game of chess we know today has been around since the 15th century where it became popular in Europe.\\n\\nThe Goal of Chess:\\nChess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.\\nThe player controlling the white pieces is named White; the player controlling the black pieces is named Black. White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control players who exceed their time limit lose the game.\\n\\nDownload free Chess Znappy app from Apple Store and enjoy the gift points, playing your favorite game with a new design. \\nEasy to access, fast and free: the player logs in with username and password or login with Facebook account.

Become a public transport tycoon and enjoy this unusual strategy and time management game with 50 challenging levels.

Get this sweet and addictive game and transport them all!\\n\\nFEATURES:\\n- 50 challenging levels\\n- 8 different buses\\n- 5 station upgrades\\n- Many zone types\\n\\nSTRATEGY TIPS:\\n- UNDERSTANDING THE CITY\\nFrom the very first moment of the level you should watch the buildings! The taller building you are looking at, the bigger potential it has! Taller buildings offer more passengers. So your first line should be going through these huge buildings!\\n\\n- CASH UNDERSTANDING\\nYou can\\xb4t win without cash. You will need a lot of cash in advanced levels! Keep reading\\u2026\\n\\n- CHOOSING CORRECT STARTING LINE\\nAs stated you should explore the city at the beggining. Start your first line on the place where there are a lot of bigger buildings! Bigger buildings mean a lot of potencial lost passengers (stolen by the taxi). This is really important to think about!\\n\\n- UPGRADING THE STATIONS\\nImagine you have bought a bus with a small capacity. So there is no sense to upgrade the stations to their maximum while you are saving money for better buses! Station upgrades are expensive! Upgrade the stations after buying a new bus. Immediately, if possible.\\n\\n- SELLING OLD VEHICLES\\nThe best strategy is to sell your buses after they have reached their final station. Let the buses serve all passengers on their line. Then sell them before reaching their depot.","Developer":"Daniel Viktorin","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":21250048,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-mouse-maze-escape-zombies-gone-wild/id834306613","Name":"Mini Mouse Maze Escape- Zombies Gone Wild","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/be/80/25/be80256b-3d1c-5788-9aff-af5d91545abf/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Remember Games like Pac Man with Arcade like graphics and maze\\u2019s .\\n\\n If you loved those, you will think this is great!

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\\n\\nPartia 2 : The Pretenders War is a sequel to Partia: The Broken Lineage. The game packs 22 stages that could present challenges to any SRPG fan.\\n\\nPartia 2 introduces many new features, including the choice of Common turn rule where all factions make moves alternatively (like Chess) instead of taking turns to move all his/her units. I believe this will bring a new nuance to gameplay if a player choose to do so. It can be toggled in intermission, and you can always play the game in the traditional FE way. (Common turn idea is from Berwick Saga) AI had improved a lot, and horse units now can move after attacking, if they have remaining move distances. \\n\\nRegrettably, the game could not deliver large animation battle. If you felt the game looked bad in Partia 1, then you\\ll find this game look much the same, except we have much bigger and nicer character portraits. It is because original Partia was never profitable, making Partia 2 production running on fume. (It sold around 6000 copies in two years) The stress of not getting paid almost broke our team of two, but somehow sheer will allowed this game to be out here for you. So whether this game series is success or not, I am immensely proud of the results. How many five year projects can a person do in a life time? ;-) Many times I was tempted to include some IAP stuff into the game and get cheap dollar or two, but I decided against it. More than anything, I rather have this game to be remembered as good, than have that IAP distaste.\\n\\nSo you may refrain from purchasing this game if you didn\\t like Partia 1.

Kakuro is one of the top logic puzzles worldwide, appearing in printed newspapers, magazines, books, and numerous software implementations for smartphones, tablets and computers.\\xa0\\n\\nWhether you are new to Kakuro or an experienced player currently using another app, you owe it to yourself to download and try Art of Kakuro. The app was designed to make the experience of playing Kakuro on a mobile device more efficient and enjoyable than anything else available. For example, in other Kakuro apps, adding notes to indicate what digits are possible in a row or column is annoyingly tedious. Art of Kakuro makes this far faster and easier by allowing multiple selections, and by allowing dragging across the number input buttons to enter multiple consecutive digits. As a result, entering notes for a row of three spaces with a sum of 10 takes 2 tap-and-swipe gestures instead of 24 taps. Advantages like these will make other apps seem frustrating once you\\ve used Art of Kakuro!\\n\\nArt of Kakuro also offers unparalleled choice in gameplay and appearance. There are a number of input control schemes used in various Kakuro apps, but only Art of Kakuro gives YOU the choice, with 11 input control variations available. Options for color scheme, background image and font allow you to find a style that looks good to YOU - and to change it periodically to keep it fresh. Portrait and landscape orientations are fully supported on both iPhones and iPads, once again giving YOU the choice of holding your device as you want.\\n\\nDownload it today and see for yourself why Art of Kakuro is the premier Kakuro experience for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\u2022 Unlimited puzzle generation of 4x4 to 9x9 puzzles (including non-square sizes) at three levels of difficulty\\n\\u2022 Selectable colors, font and background image\\n\\u2022 Hints can walk you through solving a puzzle when you get stuck - not merely filling in a number, but actually explaining the logic\\n\\u2022 Undo\\n\\u2022 Sound effects\\n\\u2022 Show number combinations for the selected row and column\\n\\u2022 Multiple input control options\\n\\u2022 Easy to read numbers (in case your eyesight is not as sharp as your mind!)\\n\\u2022 Universal app, optimized for both iPhone and iPad\\n\\u2022 Supports portrait and landscape use\\n\\u2022 Replay games to see if you improve\\n\\u2022 See your solving speed in digits per hour\\n\\u2022 Localized to English, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish","Developer":"Kevin Brain","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":4214784,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/redneck-fishing-madness-revenge/id845982873","Name":"Redneck Fishing Madness Revenge","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/43/ce/10/43ce107d-419f-2d95-84c9-769f9e9b2642/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Rods, reels, hooks and knives!

The main difficulty comes from the classical Mahjong Solitaire rules: only layouts border tiles are candidate for selection. The game is won when there is no more tile left on the board.

The main key words are: discipline, strategy and of course a little bit of luck. \\n\\nWhatever your playing mode, you can challenge your best time or your best score. For scores, you can make Combos, i.e: a specific sequence of pairs giving you more points. Best scores come from this kind of sequence: a pair of 1 followed with a pair of 2, a pair of 3 and so on until a pair of 9.

Multiplis is not just focused on getting the answer, but also understanding the process of multiplication and the strategies that kids need to develop. I love how this app supports my students\\u2019 thinking in a way no other app does.\\u201d - Alana S., K-5 Special Education Teacher\\n\\n\\u201cI really like how Mt. Multiplis combines the area model and the number line. It\\u2019s helped my students demonstrate their understanding across representations.\\u201d - Yvette B., 3rd grade teacher\\n\\nAbout the game:\\nLinka gets caught in a terrible storm while flying home after a successful treasure hunt. She escapes but her plane isn\\u2019t as lucky. Help Linka make her way through Mt. Multiplis by building bridges, unlocking treasure, and earning gems. Rebuild Linka\\u2019s plane by collecting the pieces from the greedy Crags who live on the island.   \\n\\nDeveloped by teachers and experts in children\\u2019s cognition and learning, Mt. Multiplis is an engaging game that teaches multiplication through the commutative and distributive properties. While most multiplication apps focus on drill with digital worksheets and flashcards, Mt. Multiplis scaffolds learning to promote conceptual understanding, efficiency with multiplication strategies, and fact fluency. \\n\\nThe Common Core State Standards expect third graders to use the distributive property when multiplying (CCSM.3.OA.B.5): \\u201cKnowing that 8 \\xd7 5 = 40 and 8 \\xd7 2 = 16, one can find 8 \\xd7 7 as 8 \\xd7 (5 + 2) = (8 \\xd7 5) + (8 \\xd7 2) = 40 + 16 = 56.\\u201d Mt. Multiplis is designed to make this complex content more approachable and fun for kids. Students can think strategically, seeing how 7 x 8 is the same as 5 groups of 8 plus 2 more groups of 8.\\n\\nSupports Response to Intervention programs:\\nMt.

They were cast or engraved in Bronze, recording the activities of the nobility. And were gradually lost after Qin and Han Dynasties.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the game, there are five kinds of symbols(East, South, West, North, Center) on the board. \\n\\nThe basic move of this game is horizontally or vertically swapping the positions of two adjacent symbols, to create sets of three (or more) symbols of the same shape. Each level contains a certain objective that must be completed in a given number of moves reaching a certain score. \\n\\nWhen a compass combination (west symbol to the left, east to the right, north to the upper, south to the below, center to the middle) is formed, the west symbol and east symbol are turned into \\gold symbols\\ (which removes all symbols with the same shape of the one it is matched with) and the rest 3 symbols get removed with explosion effect. \\n\\nDifferent \\special symbols\\ can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or more than 5 of the same shape in a horizontally or vertically line, a \\striped\\ symbol (which clears either an entire row or column), or a \\gold symbol\\. Special symbols can also be matched together. Matching a gold symbol with a striped symbol turns all of the symbols of its shape into striped symbols, which are immediately detonated. Matching two gold symbols will remove all the symbols on the board. Matching of two striped symbol will do a cross removal (removing both the horizontal and the vertical line at the swapping position). \\n\\nPlayers begin with five \\lives\\, lost whenever a level is failed. When they are exhausted, users will be put into the very beginning of the game. User may extend their lives by purchase 5 extra moves. \\n\\nApple Game Center is supported.

Your goal is to flip these tiles to reach a random target value in the fewest moves possible. \\n\\nEach tiles value is a certain power of 3.

To include a tile in the calculation, flip it up or down to make it green (positive) or red (negative). To exclude a tile that is already included, flip it sideways to make it gray (neutral).\\n\\nThe value of a Green tile gets added to while that of a Red tile gets subtracted from the initial value. When the initial value matches the target value in both number and color, you win. You are awarded points as well as stars for each win depending on how many moves it takes you to win.\\n\\nThere are several different levels with increasing difficulty and you can play as many games as you wish in each level.

Unlike Checkers, in this game the pieces are not captured.\\n\\nThe game strategy involves defending your home camp, while at the same time trying to take over your opponents territory.\\n\\nMOVES: Frogs or toads can move to any available adjacent lily pad.  For a turn, a player can hop or jump.  A hop is when a player taps a frog or toad and then swipes to an adjacent square as the destination.  If a frog or toad from either team occupies an adjacent position the player can jump.  Jumps earn a bonus turn.\\n\\nPass a turn by tapping the flag bearer frog or toad.  The game resets if both players pass their turns.  \\n\\nWINNING:  The first player to completely take over the other players camp wins the game.  To prevent a player from simply leaving a frog in the camp forever, a camp is considered captured if all the positions are occupied.","Developer":"Ventura Educational Systems","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":22049792,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-objects-house-in-jungle/id882244601","Name":"Hidden Objects House In Jungle","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/4f/25/73/4f25736a-94ea-ca03-a803-38fb956ee0a2/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Hidden Object game lovers.

This is the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created.\\n\\nUnique user interface\\n\\nDespite being vastly detailed under-the-hood, Democracy 3 has a unique user interface that makes visualising the connections between laws, policies, voters and situations easy. A simple iconic-based view of your countries issues allows you to drill-down through all the relationships between policies and voters to quickly analyse the impacts of your decisions. Your trade policy may affect GDP, which will affect unemployment, which will effect poverty, and thus crime, leading to a change in tourism, which affects GDP\\u2026\\n\\nComplex simulated voters\\n\\nEach individual voter is a mixture of a subset of the 21 different voter groups represented within the game. They might be a young, wealthy, liberal socialist commuter, or a retired conservative religious capitalist, for example. Not only this, but the extent to which they identify each of those groups is both variable, and can be affected by your policies in the long term. Convert your country to religion, or atheism, to capitalism, or socialism by careful and nuanced adjustment of your policies and laws over time. A focus group feature lets you look at individual voters and see exactly how they came to a decision to vote for you (or not!).\\n\\nDetailed policy model\\n\\nEach policy (or law) in the game has a slider which allows you to fine tune its intensity to get the balance just right. A series of equations within the game allows the same policy to have radically different effects on each voter group at different points in the slider, so some voters may be indifferent to a policy unless it reaches extreme levels, for example. Democracy 3 also models the global economy, including credit rating agencies and debt interest levels, as well as the impact of global events on your country.","Developer":"Positech Games","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":122864640,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiasco-frog-hop-leap-and-jump-with-henry-the-crazy-toad/id882565373","Name":"Fiasco Frog - Hop, Leap and Jump with Henry the Crazy Toad","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/0c/a5/c6/0ca5c672-262d-bc05-4bdd-1617c119601c/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"It\\u2019s time for a muddy adventure!

Control mighty battle ship turrets and try to defeat the other captian. You have to sink the oponens battleship by bombing it with rockets and missiles. Both players play on the same device against each other. If there is just one player this player could play against a computer controlled enemy.\\n\\nGameplay and controls:\\nOn a playround two oponens face each others battleships. Each battleship has four turrets. At the beginning these canons are normal canons, but can be specialized and upgraded during the game. The turrets swing on a 90 degrees angle by themselves. The player can fire a canon by touching it. A fired canon needs to cool down for three seconds (greyed out). To hit the enemys battleship the player has to time the touching to lunch missiles to the right direction. Rockets can be catched and stopped by other rockets. If two rockets collide that player gets some gamecash the side the collision happened on. Players can buy turret upgrades from this gamecash every 60seconds (end of playround) on a special upgrade menu. If a player brings the lifebar of the enemy to zero the battleship explodes and the player wins.\\n\\nUpgrades:\\nEach normal canon can be upgraded to one of four special turret systems. Once chosen these upgrades cant be removed or downgraded. Specialized canons can be upgraded two times to a higher level within their kind.\\n\\nHEAT: The heat canon is a pure defence weapon that cant damage the enemys battleship. Instead of rockets this turret sends out a special heat wave that can destroy multiple missiles.\\n\\nMINI: The mini-gun canon lunches normal rockets but has a lowered cool down time. This makes it possible to cause a real rainshower of bombs on the highest upgrade level.\\n\\nSTUN: The stun canon fires eletric bolts instead of missiles. These cant damage the enemys battleship but can disable enemy turrets for a while instead.\\n\\nCLUST: The cluster canon lunches special rockets that split up on their way to multiple normal missiles and causing therefor a lot of damage.\\n\\nTORPEDO: The torpedo canon fires torpedos that go under water. They cant be stopped or bounced. \\n\\nBOUNCE: The bounce canon fires a shockwave that bounces back all normal missiles.\\n\\n--\\nMade in Berlin, Germany","Developer":"Marco Kehler","Age_Rating":"9+","Size":17678336,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2048-number-slider-puzzle-for-ipad/id888301660","Name":"2048 - number slider puzzle for iPad","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple6/v4/02/41/3e/02413ee2-b4f6-d931-cb2e-f78461bc627d/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"This is a puzzle game in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with 2048 number.","Developer":"Santosh Surve","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":1396736,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bingo-bongo-free-bingo-game/id888304079","Name":"Bingo Bongo - Free Bingo Game","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple2/v4/26/28/bd/2628bdd1-888b-7998-2a9d-d1be015a7bc2/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Play Free Bingo now with Bingo Bongo!\\n\\nThere are 12 locations to unlock as you play 1, 2, 3 or even 4 cards at a time in this fast-paced Bingo game!\\n\\nSwitch quickly between your active cards, daub fast then call Bingo - can you keep up?
