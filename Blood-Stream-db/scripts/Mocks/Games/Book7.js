Until you have succeeded in melding some tiles, you must begin each turn by taking the next available tile from the wall or the last tile discarded. Then if you have combinations of sufficient value (45 points), you may meld some tiles from your rack. To end your turn you must discard one tile from your hand face up. The discarded tiles are placed near the top of the table in a row, in the order they were discarded.\\n\\nFor your first meld, you must put down combinations from your rack with the following constraints:\\n - the tiles you meld must include at least one run;\\n - the total value of the melded tiles must be at least 45 points.\\n\\nFor this purpose the tiles have point values as follows:\\n - 2 to 9: 5 points each\\n - 10 to 13: 10 points each\\n - 1 in a run of 1-2-3-...: 5 points\\n - 1 in a run of ...-12-13-1: 10 points\\n - 1\\s in a set: 25 points each\\nA Joly has the value of the tile it represents.\\n\\nIn order to be allowed to meld any tiles at all, you must first meld from your hand sets and runs to a total value of at least 45 points.

According to Wikipedia it\\s also popular amongst backpackers, and as a result is widespread.\\n\\nThis version of palace is two player, you versus computer. There are eight different computer characters you can play against, each with slightly different playing styles.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n1. Tap on cards to select/deselect. You can select one or more cards of the same kind. Click on the discard pile or use swipe gesture to discard selected cards.\\n2. Use the Undo button (top right of screen) to undo last move if you make a mistake.\\n3. Turn screen sideways to make view wider when you have a lot of cards in your hand.\\n\\nBasic Rules:\\n\\nEach player is dealt 3 \\face down cards\\. You are not allowed to see or change these until the end of the game. Next, 3 \\face up cards\\ are placed on top. Finally, each player is dealt 3 cards to form their hand. If you wish, you can switch cards from your \\hand\\ with your \\face up cards\\.;\\n\\nWhoever has a 3 or the next lowest card starts the game.\\n\\nEach turn you must discard a card (or two or more cards of the same) greater than or equal to the one at the top of the pick up pile, then draw cards from the deck so you have at least 3 cards in your hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or you already have 3 or more cards in you hand).\\n\\n2\\s and 10\\s are wild cards. 2\\s resets the pile and 10\\s clear the pile. 4 of a kind, like a 10, clears the pile.\\n\\nIf don\\t have a card that is greater than or equal to the card on top of the pile or a wild card, you must pick up the entire pile.\\n\\nWhen there are no more cards in your hand, and the deck is empty, proceed to play your face up cards. Once all of the face up cards have been played, play the face down cards.\\n\\nIf you are the first to get rid of all your cards you win.","Developer":"GLOBE NETWORKING LLC","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":60160000,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speed-text/id955306639","Name":"Speed-Text","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple127/v4/db/9e/88/db9e88ea-7685-b92b-9e59-7e4d83a5b9ad/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"How fast can you text?\\n\\nRace the clock by texting as fast and as accurately as you can.\\n\\nFEATURES:\\n- 12 Different Levels (prove your skills) \\n- 100+ sentences to type\\n- WPM (Word Per Minute) Calculation\\n\\nGAME CENTER READY:\\n- Challenge your friends to beat your high scores\\n- Achievements\\n- High Scores Leaderboard\\n- Top WPM Leaderboard","Developer":"Omose Ogala","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":15220736,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fight-off-dont-make-them-fall-or-jump-ship/id955307792","Name":"Fight Off - Dont Make Them Fall Or Jump Ship!","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/4f/23/a6/4f23a68b-78ad-3582-46ee-faaf291e0287/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":" \\n\\nThis Game Really Takes My Blues!

Includes an interactive tutorial to get beginners up to speed. Includes randomly generated puzzles for infinite replay value! \\n\\nHow To Play \\n--------------- \\nThe goal of a nonogram puzzle is to fill all the correct blocks in a grid. The key to solving each puzzle is the numbers on the top and left of the grid. Each number gives you a clue about how many blocks are filled in each row or column. For example, if the clue for a row was 4 3 1, that means there are four sequentially filled blocks, a gap of one (or more), three filled blocks, another gap, and then finally one filled block on its own. In a 10x10 puzzle grid, this clue solves the whole row: 4 filled + 1 blank + 3 filled + 1 blank + 1 filled = 10 total. Solve easy clues first, then you can logically fill in the rest of the blocks in the grid.

Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini\\n\\n5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If youre thinking about this one, youll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!\\n\\n5/5 - This game should get much more hype. Ive been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the devs have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. Its not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!\\n\\n5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. Its not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (havent beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).","Developer":"Kalypso Media Group GmbH","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":693882880,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viking-saga-3-epic-adventure/id958588247","Name":"Viking Saga 3: Epic Adventure","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/80/39/f0/8039f02b-e6d9-8998-576b-6c9f95692ddd/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Discover Viking Saga - Epic Adventure, the next fantastic chapter in the hit action series! \\nLodin, Dalas greedy father, doesnt approve of the marriage between his daughter and Ingolf.

No, no, no, this is not a any fairytale, this is true story of alien invasion to the earth. Huge among of alien troops attacks to earth planet and your goal is to guide and lead United Alliance to victorious battle and wipe out aliens out of galaxy. Aliens have conquered galaxies and planets one by one, but now its time to stop them finally, before their actually reach our precious tellus planet.\\nPeople in earth are huge danger, alien troops have big technology advantage and huge waves of soldiers. Aliens are also really nasty creatures, their have big teeth and poison tentacles. Only good strategy and great logical moves can save our planet middle on this invasion. You can start to strike back one wave at a time and try to kill as many enemies as possible with a single move, you dont have afford any mistakes.

Now its time real war action and you need to kick them butt out of world. You specify the path to the fate of the human race...\\n\\n[ Aliens background ]\\n\\nAlien race is more or less a hybrid cross between a spider and octopus. They can move really fast using tentacles. Alien queen can birth alien eggs really fast and they grow to adults quite short time period, so their number is growing rapidly. Aliens are from Sirius Nebula and they conquered lots of planets. Their technology is a few hundred a year ahead of us and they have already developed teleportation. Luckily our latest laser weapons can destroy their star ships and blow their slime bodies away.\\nAliens started their journey couple hundred years ago and started to conquer the universe. They have been victorious when they travelled around universe and their number has grown to billions. They seem to think that there is no race that can fight back and they are superior race in the Universe. Maybe this is their only weakness.\\n\\n[ How to play ]\\n\\nYou control your strikes by selecting alien or group of aliens by your finger. This will destroy aliens which are connected together with a telepathic link. Alien telepathic link is connected when aliens touching others horizontally or vertically and their are coloured with a same colour. There are six different coloured alien orcs (red, blue, green, yellow, purple and oranges). So you have to plan your strikes well so you could make huge link between aliens. You have two rounds to make a strike before new wave is coming closer. If aliens reach the earth, its end of mankind living on globe. You really need to grow your experience and intelligence to finally reach the victory of the battle.\\n\\nAre you ready on this battle and rescue world nations globally and protect our beautiful planet.

Alternately each player puts a disc in one row. The disc falls down straight and will only be stopped by another piece. The aim is to be the first of the two players to connect four discs of the same color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If each cell of the grid is filled and no player has already connected four discs, the game ends drawn, so no player wins.\\n\\n Strategy to win 4 in a row\\n\\nOne strategy to win this game is to prepare two chances to connect four discs at once, therefore setting up a double bind. This will consequently lead to the victory, since the player can only avoid one of the two chances.\\n\\n A perfect solution for a Connect4 game with 7 rows is already mathematically proven. Assuming a perfect play and best defense by both players the beginning player will always win by starting with the middle row. The decision to start at any other row will ultimately lead to a draw, if both players play perfect. Therefore it is also possible to play the game with 8 rows, a modus which is not solved mathematically yet.","Developer":"Ekraft","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":6897664,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mouse-mayhem-trap-no-escape/id962044064","Name":"Mouse Mayhem Trap: No Escape","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/cb/a4/e4/cba4e4e4-a99a-8a45-23b6-2165776d40b9/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Leaping lizards!

If the last two cards of a suite is on each end of the table, the game is said to be blocked the player that has the lowest count will be the winner of that game.

Or... put your feet up, mow down some levels and let the world take care of itself.\\n\\nOrbit Classic is a focused and minimalist dexterity puzzle game where your main goal is to get your shooting balls into one of three orbits without colliding with other balls. Once you place all of the balls into orbit, you advance to the next level. \\n\\nAlthough the game design keeps it simple, there are also a lot of twists and challenges that keep you on your toes. Levels become more complex by changing the direction of the orbits, speeding up, slowing down and adding other variations and obstacles.  More difficult levels give you a little help by allowing you to shoot balls out of the way with special shooting stars, and allowing you to earn bonuses  (extra shooting stars and spare lives which allow you to continue after having a ball collision). \\n\\nIf you love games, this is a great one to add to your library and challenge yourself to advance as high as you can through the levels.  The game is simple and elegant without a lot of distractions, yet dig deeper and there is a depth of interesting gameplay and strategy for more competitive players. \\n\\nIf you hate games, well, this is an anti-game.  Its simple and fun without all the cartoons, candy crushing, hype, points, mandatory social sharing, asking friends to send you lives and all the other rigmarole and complications associated with your typical popular games.

Build your land, collect gold, and cut your opponents land, to get points. The first player to reach the target score in the upper right corner wins.\\n\\nTo master the game you need physical skills, but especially when you get better the game gets tactical. The game is very challenging at higher skill levels, and you really have to plan your moves. Although the game is challenging, its still not stressful. You will meet an AI opponent that tries to think and act better than you, in a nice and harmonic way. There is no boss mode, but trust me, you might lose anyhow.\\n\\nYou can play the game in three modes:\\n- Against a human like AI on the device\\n- Against a random player in the World League\\n- Against a friend on the same device\\n\\nIt is not a walk in the park to get ten stars against the AI. Cucumber Fields will give you many hours of fun, challenging and interesting game play. Ive tried to make the AI as human like as possible, and Im very satisfied with the result. When you are half way, and have five stars against the AI, youre allowed to enter the World League and challenge other players from all around the world. Try to reach to the top!

The final picture shows 8 turned kings. \\n\\nIn addition, there are 2 auxiliary packages (B) which begin in each case with a black king and with a red king. On them you can lay  Q, J, 10, 9 . . . 3, 2.\\n\\nThe game goes on, while one turns the talon (D) card for card. Every card is to be checked whether it fits on an ace foundation piles (A) (with subsequent cards) or on a kings piles (B) (with subsequent cards). The kings piles (B) let themselves put down in the course of the game often card for card on an ace foundation pile (A). Then the free-become kings place again may be booked with a king. Every turned card of the talon which cannot be used is filed openly on the pile (E). If all cards are turned, the pile (E) becomes the talon (D) again - this may often happen arbitrarily. \\n\\nFor every laid card you get points. Bonus points will award for every concluded ace pile. \\n\\nYour sixth best games are put down on the top list.","Developer":"Gerhard Lentschik","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":34207744,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heroes-guard-the-journal/id968451126","Name":"Heroes Guard: The Journal","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple30/v4/28/23/04/2823046e-4c42-d49f-661b-6d9976217b19/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"In Heroes Guard: The Journal, you are a weary and weathered adventurer.\\n\\nAll of your questing and dungeon plundering days are behind you - but that doesn\\u2019t mean your stories of hardships and triumphs need be forgotten!

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\\n\\nPartia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the Granian Trilogy. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.\\n\\nThe game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.\\n\\nIt is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks meh, in most places at best.\\n\\nBut if theres any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.\\n\\nBut Ive had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. Im sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.\\n\\nNow mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself!\\nI realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As Im writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.\\n\\nAnyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. Im not even tracking any data as, frankly I dont see a point in doing that. You see I am already resigned to the fate this little big indie game is for the lovers only.\\n\\nFor The Lovers Only.\\n\\nSo this may be the final time I write a game description on an App Store. Or maybe not.\\n\\nWhoever you are, I hope you enjoy. If you can, please let me know how you find your experience.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nDustin","Developer":"Imago Software","Age_Rating":"9+","Size":139576320,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imbroglio/id969264934","Name":"Imbroglio","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/bf/43/b6/bf43b669-2087-7162-b4f0-be22ad6e02c8/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Every individual element of Imbroglio\\u2019s design coalesces into an elegantly complex whole.

You start each round with six dice. Tap the cup and roll them, and select the ones that provide the best score. (Sometimes you may want to just select one 1 or a 5 so you can score and re-roll all the remaining dice. The more dice you have for subsequent rolls, the greater your chance for getting a higher-scoring combination, like a three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind!) A round ends when you tap to bank your score, or when you roll and don\\t score any points, in which case You\\re Busted!\\n\\nTo bank your points and move on to the next round, tap on the prompt in the left-hand column that says Tap to Bank. Otherwise, tap the dice cup to roll the remaining dice. But beware: If you roll and don\\t score any points - You\\re Busted! You lose any points you had won during that round.\\n\\nIf you use ALL six dice in one round, you can either bank your score and move to the next round, OR you can Roll Again with six new dice.  Just remember you have more points at stake! If you\\re lucky, you can really rack up the points in a single round. As an added bonus when you use all six dice and bank your score, the points from that round will be added to your score in the following round, as long as you don\\t get busted in that round!\\n\\nYou break even with your bet by scoring at least 5,000 points. Plus, you win your bet for each 1,000 points you score over 5,000.\\n\\nFor example, if you bet 10 coins, and your score after Round 10 was 6,200....you would win 20 coins! That\\s 10 coins for scoring 5,000, and then 10 coins for scoring 1,000 points over 5,000. If your score had been 9,200....you would have won 50 coins!\\n\\nThe instructions and scoring table are literally at your fingertips! Just tap the Instructions button on the main menu at any time.  But we think you\\ll get the hang of High Roller pretty quickly: To score, you need either a 1 or a 5; 3 pairs; three or more of a kind; or a straight (5 dice or six dice).  Just don\\t get busted!\\n\\nWe give you 420 free coins to start, plus an additional 20 free coins every day you play. And if you want any more coins, you can buy them at any time using our in-app purchase option. We have five value packs for you to choose from.\\n\\nHigh Roller Free Dice Game is ad-supported.

Some larger pieces of space debris are harder to destroy and need to be hit with the laser multiple times!\\n\\nAnother way to destroy larger pieces of debris is to make them fall into the atmosphere.\\nOnce it leaves its orbit, and enters the atmosphere (the bottom area of the screen), the frictional heat will lead to the debris being destroyed.\\nYou can even disrupt the trajectory of large debris by firing small shots with your laser.\\n \\nLaser Attacks \\nTouch the screen to unleash the laser energy.\\nSome debris cannot be easily destroyed. Larger debris will require multiple shots from your laser cannon.\\nYour laser cannon will overheat  after a while and you\\u2019ll need to wait until it cools before you start using it again.\\n\\nWatch Out! \\nYour game will be over when your shield reaches 0%.\\nWhen your ship is not doing anything (non-operational), your shield will recover little by little.\\n\\n- Auto Pilot Mode  *Select this option to bring up the menu\\nUse this mode to destroy space debris automatically.\\nIf you want to get away from the game for a short while or if you feel like gazing down at the beautiful planet and enjoying the sound, switch this option on.\\nAlthough the Auto Pilot Mode is good, it is by no means perfect. It does not improvise for every situation, so use at your own risk!\\n\\n- Tune Up Your Spaceship\\nAccumulate GUP for removing debris and use them to strengthen the equipment on your spaceship.\\nWarning!! When you lose, your spaceship will return to its original state.\\nYou can purchase parts to tune up your spaceship at any time.\\n\\n- Challenge the Secret missions\\nReady to Challenge the Secret Missions?\\nIn addition to the mammoth task of clearing all the space debris, there are 26 hidden missions.\\n\\n- Get Ready!\\nThese are unlocked in a variety of ways. \\nMissions include defending the Earth from a giant meteorite, encounters with unknown spacecraft and defending against attacks from the unknown spacecraft, Star gliders\\nCareful! If a huge meteorite falls to Earth, your game will be over.\\n\\n- Help Raise Awareness of Space Debris\\n\\nWhat is it?\\nParts disconnected from the satellites and rockets, peeling paint from degrading space material, as well as debris such as insulation, tools used by astronauts and various other man-made objects. Such debris has become strewn across space.\\nEvery year, this problem continues to grow, and we will need to find a solid solution soon.","Developer":"Happymeal Inc.","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":179470336,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-derp-the-impossible-virtual-pet-game/id979187894","Name":"My Derp - The Impossible Virtual Pet Game","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/f9/53/6c/f9536c24-84d2-5c44-53f1-0b6a52254985/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Meet your Derp: NOT the cute lovely boring virtual pet you are used to.

When a man reaches the back row, it is promoted to a king at the end of the move. Kings may move any number of squares forwards, backwards or sideways, capturing by jumping over any piece and landing on any square within permissible path beyond the captured piece.\\n\\nPieces are removed immediately after being jumped. If a jump is possible, it must be done. If several ways of jumping are possible, the one that captures the most pieces must be chosen. No difference between king and man is made during capture; each counts as one piece. If there is more than one way to capture the maximally possible number of pieces, the player may choose which to take. Within a multicapture, turning 180 degrees between two captures is not allowed.\\n\\nThe game ends when a player has no legal move, either because all his pieces are captured or he is completely blocked.

Operate a successful dinosaur park by attracting many visitors. Join the community and build your own creation! \\n\\nCreate your own unique tour with different stations so visitors can observe the dinosaurs. The more likes you collect the more funds you accumulate (a heads up: locating the dinosaurs drinking and feeding bowls close to the stations is key). With your extra earned cash, expand the park with further services and amenities for visitors, such as gift shops, hotels, restaurants, while you are also in charge of securing food and water supplies, electricity and a necessary security system. A volcano nearby and unpredictable weather are additional challenges to manage your park successfully. \\n\\nAnd don\\u2019t forget: dinosaurs can escape and chase visitors! So make sure to build safe heavens and provide swift assistance and evacuation for the visitors to safely operate your park. \\n\\nOf course the happiness and well-being of the dinosaurs are of equal importance. Build them comfortable, clean enclosures with many plants, rocks, and lots of food and drinking spots. Otherwise they will just die after a short time. And no visitor wants to see a sick dinosaur! Did a Dino escape? No worries, you will have a variety of tools at your disposal to catch them and to restore the operation of your park.  \\n\\nKey features:\\n\\u25cf authentic simulation and endless arrangements, \\n\\u25cf 9 different type of meat and plant-eating dinosaurs,\\n\\u25cf 15 different buildings,\\n\\u25cf unrestricted construction of road and animal enclosures,\\n\\u25cf a large space to build your own park,\\n\\u25cf a variety of challenges and scenarios ,\\n\\u25cf share the favorite pictures of your park with your friends,\\n\\u25cf excellent sound-effects and 3D animation\\n\\nThe Jurassic Island: The Dinosaur Zoo Quastion and Answer:\\n\\nQ: Will I get notifications all the time and is this an online game?\\nA: No and no!
