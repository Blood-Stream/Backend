The insurgents also have a bigger brother, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). This well trained, conventional army have much wider ambitions than the VC, they want to take total control of the valley, a stepping stone to unifying North Vietnam with the South under communist rule.  The NVA conducts operations from across the border, primarily aimed at supporting the insurgency and launching offensives when the time is right.   To carry out your COIN mission, co-ordination of ground troops, special forces, artillery, mechanized units, training of local forces (ARVN) and airmobile assets is essential, but of greater consequence is winning the support of the local population.

Rummy is played with a set of 106 tiles. 104 of them are made from colorful numbers  from 1 to 13, in 4 colors: red, green, blue and black; 2 of the pieces are Joly / Joker, unnumbered. At each turn you draw one tile and discard one.  The object of the game is to collect tiles that form valid sets and runs, which can then be melded (placed face up on the table in front of you). Until you have succeeded in melding some tiles, you must begin each turn by taking the next available tile from the wall or the last tile discarded. Then if you have combinations of sufficient value (45 points), you may meld some tiles from your rack. To end your turn you must discard one tile from your hand face up. The discarded tiles are placed near the top of the table in a row, in the order they were discarded.  For your first meld, you must put down combinations from your rack with the following constraints:  - the tiles you meld must include at least one run;  - the total value of the melded tiles must be at least 45 points.  For this purpose the tiles have point values as follows:  - 2 to 9: 5 points each  - 10 to 13: 10 points each  - 1 in a run of 1-2-3-...: 5 points  - 1 in a run of ...-12-13-1: 10 points  - 1\\s in a set: 25 points each A Joly has the value of the tile it represents.  In order to be allowed to meld any tiles at all, you must first meld from your hand sets and runs to a total value of at least 45 points. After you have done that, then in this and subsequent turns, after drawing and before discarding, you may meld further sets and runs, and add tiles to sets and runs that are yours or other players have previously melded.   Closure is achieved when the player has all 14 tiles in valid runs and groups, the 15\\th stones remains free and select the option Meld - the green button in the bottom right corner of his game area.

Quotes from Beta Testers:   In terms of turn based tactics this is very unique. This is the first one of its kind to use 3 dimensions that I know of for movement and placement, and it works and functions very well. In fact this is the only true 3d strategy space game that I can think of since Homeworld movement-wise.   The details are great, especially with the battle. Keep up the good work!   I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that I can ram, and/or fire upon my fellow ship(s) if I am not careful.  The concept of the game is great.

You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. \\tBut wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill your treasury.

According to Wikipedia it\\s also popular amongst backpackers, and as a result is widespread.  This version of palace is two player, you versus computer. There are eight different computer characters you can play against, each with slightly different playing styles.  Tips:  1. Tap on cards to select/deselect. You can select one or more cards of the same kind. Click on the discard pile or use swipe gesture to discard selected cards. 2. Use the Undo button (top right of screen) to undo last move if you make a mistake. 3. Turn screen sideways to make view wider when you have a lot of cards in your hand.  Basic Rules:  Each player is dealt 3 \\face down cards\\. You are not allowed to see or change these until the end of the game. Next, 3 \\face up cards\\ are placed on top. Finally, each player is dealt 3 cards to form their hand. If you wish, you can switch cards from your \\hand\\ with your \\face up cards\\.;  Whoever has a 3 or the next lowest card starts the game.  Each turn you must discard a card (or two or more cards of the same) greater than or equal to the one at the top of the pick up pile, then draw cards from the deck so you have at least 3 cards in your hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or you already have 3 or more cards in you hand).  2\\s and 10\\s are wild cards. 2\\s resets the pile and 10\\s clear the pile. 4 of a kind, like a 10, clears the pile.  If don\\t have a card that is greater than or equal to the card on top of the pile or a wild card, you must pick up the entire pile.  When there are no more cards in your hand, and the deck is empty, proceed to play your face up cards. Once all of the face up cards have been played, play the face down cards.

You can select draw 1 or draw 3 cards, and it supports up to 3 undo moves.  Game Goal  The goal of Klondike Solitaire is to remove all the cards from the table and place them in sequential order to the foundations.  Game Rules  The game starts with dealing a shuffled 52-card deck, (no jokers).  The cards are then all dealt into six piles, from left to right, each one increasing in the number of cards per pile.  (The first pile has a single face up card, the second pile has one face down, one face up, etc.)  The remaining cards are left in the draw pile.  These cards can be drawn one at a time (or three depending on your settings), and used within the game.  The cards are then moved to the foundation piles one by one, starting with Ace to King.  The foundation piles must match the suit of the card.   Foundation piles start with an Ace, and are finished when a King is placed on the foundation.  Cards can be removed from the foundation piles to be used in play.  Cards can be stacked on each other sequentially, however they must alternate suit color.  A Heart or Diamond (RED), must be topped with a Spade or Club (BLACK), and then continued with a red suit alternating.  Winning Condition  When all the foundation piles are complete from Ace to King, the game is over.

Includes an interactive tutorial to get beginners up to speed. Includes randomly generated puzzles for infinite replay value!   How To Play  ---------------  The goal of a nonogram puzzle is to fill all the correct blocks in a grid. The key to solving each puzzle is the numbers on the top and left of the grid. Each number gives you a clue about how many blocks are filled in each row or column. For example, if the clue for a row was 4 3 1, that means there are four sequentially filled blocks, a gap of one (or more), three filled blocks, another gap, and then finally one filled block on its own. In a 10x10 puzzle grid, this clue solves the whole row: 4 filled + 1 blank + 3 filled + 1 blank + 1 filled = 10 total. Solve easy clues first, then you can logically fill in the rest of the blocks in the grid.

Not as much story/length as final fantasy tactics, but frankly on iDevices I consider that a win. Bite sized battles, winnable in a day on easy, challenging on hard, good replay value. Only crashed once on 1st gen mini  5/5 - This is worth your money. You get a polished game, tactical battles, and thoughtful choices in exploration. Also big points for splitting the game into two difficulties. One being sort of roguelike with permadeath and the other much more RPG without permadeath and with consistent leveling. If youre thinking about this one, youll probably thoroughly enjoy it like I do!  5/5 - This game should get much more hype. Ive been playing it non-stop in my free time for over a week. Despite some bugs (which the devs have been very quick to address), Each game feels quite different with the random locations within areas, random loot and different party builds. Its not easy at first, but learning different strategies as you go is enjoyable. Highly recommend this game!  5/5 - Big fan of this game. The battles are very tactical and the map navigation is really streamlined and fun to explore. This is a good one for any rogue-like fans. Its not super punishing, but it does present a nice challenge on the normal mode (havent beaten it yet, but I hope a hard mode unlocks after doing so).', Developer: 'Kalypso Media Group GmbH', Age_Rating: '12+', Size: 693882880, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viking-saga-3-epic-adventure/id958588247', Name: 'Viking Saga 3: Epic Adventure', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/80/39/f0/8039f02b-e6d9-8998-576b-6c9f95692ddd/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Discover Viking Saga - Epic Adventure, the next fantastic chapter in the hit action series!

No, no, no, this is not a any fairytale, this is true story of alien invasion to the earth. Huge among of alien troops attacks to earth planet and your goal is to guide and lead United Alliance to victorious battle and wipe out aliens out of galaxy. Aliens have conquered galaxies and planets one by one, but now its time to stop them finally, before their actually reach our precious tellus planet. People in earth are huge danger, alien troops have big technology advantage and huge waves of soldiers. Aliens are also really nasty creatures, their have big teeth and poison tentacles. Only good strategy and great logical moves can save our planet middle on this invasion. You can start to strike back one wave at a time and try to kill as many enemies as possible with a single move, you dont have afford any mistakes. Because you are fight in front line, you have to plan your and Alliance battalion moves carefully and strike back at full force all the time. Now its time real war action and you need to kick them butt out of world. You specify the path to the fate of the human race...  [ Aliens background ]  Alien race is more or less a hybrid cross between a spider and octopus. They can move really fast using tentacles. Alien queen can birth alien eggs really fast and they grow to adults quite short time period, so their number is growing rapidly. Aliens are from Sirius Nebula and they conquered lots of planets. Their technology is a few hundred a year ahead of us and they have already developed teleportation. Luckily our latest laser weapons can destroy their star ships and blow their slime bodies away. Aliens started their journey couple hundred years ago and started to conquer the universe. They have been victorious when they travelled around universe and their number has grown to billions. They seem to think that there is no race that can fight back and they are superior race in the Universe. Maybe this is their only weakness.  [ How to play ]  You control your strikes by selecting alien or group of aliens by your finger. This will destroy aliens which are connected together with a telepathic link. Alien telepathic link is connected when aliens touching others horizontally or vertically and their are coloured with a same colour.

The game is played with a seven-column and six-row grid, which is arranged upright. Alternately each player puts a disc in one row. The disc falls down straight and will only be stopped by another piece. The aim is to be the first of the two players to connect four discs of the same color vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If each cell of the grid is filled and no player has already connected four discs, the game ends drawn, so no player wins.   Strategy to win 4 in a row  One strategy to win this game is to prepare two chances to connect four discs at once, therefore setting up a double bind. This will consequently lead to the victory, since the player can only avoid one of the two chances.   A perfect solution for a Connect4 game with 7 rows is already mathematically proven. Assuming a perfect play and best defense by both players the beginning player will always win by starting with the middle row. The decision to start at any other row will ultimately lead to a draw, if both players play perfect. Therefore it is also possible to play the game with 8 rows, a modus which is not solved mathematically yet.', Developer: 'Ekraft', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 6897664, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mouse-mayhem-trap-no-escape/id962044064', Name: 'Mouse Mayhem Trap: No Escape', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/cb/a4/e4/cba4e4e4-a99a-8a45-23b6-2165776d40b9/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Leaping lizards!

It was exciting to try and convert the feeling from strategy board games into a real time experience. Unfortunately, it is not practical to have real time strategy games without digital assistance, so the iPad was chosen as optimal platform for this experiment.  I wanted the game to feature recognizable elements from normal strategy games:  - Upgrading (tap and hold star) - Attack (send out comets towards enemy star) - Defense (send out comets against incoming enemy comets) - Resource management (balancing attack, defense and upgrading) - Tactics (choose an unpredictable route for your comets or make a timing attack when opponent is weak after upgrading)  Good luck - have fun!

Once you place all of the balls into orbit, you advance to the next level.   Although the game design keeps it simple, there are also a lot of twists and challenges that keep you on your toes. Levels become more complex by changing the direction of the orbits, speeding up, slowing down and adding other variations and obstacles.  More difficult levels give you a little help by allowing you to shoot balls out of the way with special shooting stars, and allowing you to earn bonuses  (extra shooting stars and spare lives which allow you to continue after having a ball collision).   If you love games, this is a great one to add to your library and challenge yourself to advance as high as you can through the levels.  The game is simple and elegant without a lot of distractions, yet dig deeper and there is a depth of interesting gameplay and strategy for more competitive players.   If you hate games, well, this is an anti-game.  Its simple and fun without all the cartoons, candy crushing, hype, points, mandatory social sharing, asking friends to send you lives and all the other rigmarole and complications associated with your typical popular games.  Its the perfect game for people who think they don\\t like games. \\u200b Download Orbit Classic today from the Apple iTunes store!

The rules are simple. Build your land, collect gold, and cut your opponents land, to get points. The first player to reach the target score in the upper right corner wins.  To master the game you need physical skills, but especially when you get better the game gets tactical. The game is very challenging at higher skill levels, and you really have to plan your moves. Although the game is challenging, its still not stressful. You will meet an AI opponent that tries to think and act better than you, in a nice and harmonic way. There is no boss mode, but trust me, you might lose anyhow.  You can play the game in three modes: - Against a human like AI on the device - Against a random player in the World League - Against a friend on the same device  It is not a walk in the park to get ten stars against the AI. Cucumber Fields will give you many hours of fun, challenging and interesting game play. Ive tried to make the AI as human like as possible, and Im very satisfied with the result. When you are half way, and have five stars against the AI, youre allowed to enter the World League and challenge other players from all around the world. Try to reach to the top! As a bonus you can also play with a friend on the same device.  Im a single developer that have enjoyed investing thousands of hours into this game, for years, after my 9 to 5 work.

To win, the points earned from each of the ten rounds must total 5,000 or higher. For scoring 5,000 points, you win the amount of coins you bet at the beginning of the round. Plus, you also win the amount of coins you bet for each 1,000 points over 5,000.  For example, if you bet 10 coins, and your score after Round 10 was 6,200....you would win 20 coins! That\\s 10 coins for scoring 5,000, and then 10 coins for scoring 1,000 points over 5,000.  If your score had been 9,200....you would have won 50 coins!

Every pile in the game is to be laid alternately with a red and black card.  To begin there are four decks with 10 cards (C). The uppermost card is uncovered and can be played.   On the  eight foundation piles (A) it starts with the aces if they appear in the play course. On them are laying  2, 3, 4. . . .  Q, K). The final picture shows 8 turned kings.   In addition, there are 2 auxiliary packages (B) which begin in each case with a black king and with a red king. On them you can lay  Q, J, 10, 9 . . . 3, 2.  The game goes on, while one turns the talon (D) card for card. Every card is to be checked whether it fits on an ace foundation piles (A) (with subsequent cards) or on a kings piles (B) (with subsequent cards). The kings piles (B) let themselves put down in the course of the game often card for card on an ace foundation pile (A). Then the free-become kings place again may be booked with a king. Every turned card of the talon which cannot be used is filed openly on the pile (E). If all cards are turned, the pile (E) becomes the talon (D) again - this may often happen arbitrarily.   For every laid card you get points. Bonus points will award for every concluded ace pile.   Your sixth best games are put down on the top list.', Developer: 'Gerhard Lentschik', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 34207744, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heroes-guard-the-journal/id968451126', Name: 'Heroes Guard: The Journal', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple30/v4/28/23/04/2823046e-4c42-d49f-661b-6d9976217b19/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'In Heroes Guard: The Journal, you are a weary and weathered adventurer.

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.  Partia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the Granian Trilogy. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.  The game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.  It is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks meh, in most places at best.  But if theres any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.  But Ive had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. Im sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.  Now mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself! I realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As Im writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.  Anyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. Im not even tracking any data as, frankly I dont see a point in doing that.

If more than one player occupies a city the one with the most meeples will get the points.  The game ends when all tiles are placed.

There are ten rounds in each game. You start each round with six dice. Tap the cup and roll them, and select the ones that provide the best score. (Sometimes you may want to just select one 1 or a 5 so you can score and re-roll all the remaining dice. The more dice you have for subsequent rolls, the greater your chance for getting a higher-scoring combination, like a three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind!) A round ends when you tap to bank your score, or when you roll and don\\t score any points, in which case You\\re Busted!  To bank your points and move on to the next round, tap on the prompt in the left-hand column that says Tap to Bank. Otherwise, tap the dice cup to roll the remaining dice. But beware: If you roll and don\\t score any points - You\\re Busted! You lose any points you had won during that round.  If you use ALL six dice in one round, you can either bank your score and move to the next round, OR you can Roll Again with six new dice.  Just remember you have more points at stake! If you\\re lucky, you can really rack up the points in a single round. As an added bonus when you use all six dice and bank your score, the points from that round will be added to your score in the following round, as long as you don\\t get busted in that round!  You break even with your bet by scoring at least 5,000 points. Plus, you win your bet for each 1,000 points you score over 5,000.  For example, if you bet 10 coins, and your score after Round 10 was 6,200....you would win 20 coins! That\\s 10 coins for scoring 5,000, and then 10 coins for scoring 1,000 points over 5,000. If your score had been 9,200....you would have won 50 coins!  The instructions and scoring table are literally at your fingertips! Just tap the Instructions button on the main menu at any time.  But we think you\\ll get the hang of High Roller pretty quickly: To score, you need either a 1 or a 5; 3 pairs; three or more of a kind; or a straight (5 dice or six dice).  Just don\\t get busted!  We give you 420 free coins to start, plus an additional 20 free coins every day you play. And if you want any more coins, you can buy them at any time using our in-app purchase option. We have five value packs for you to choose from.  High Roller Free Dice Game is ad-supported. We also have an ads-free Pro version available for $0.99.  High Roller Free Dice Game and High Roller Pro are simulated gambling for entertainment purposes only.

Developed over 1600 years ago it is still a challenging game of strategy for 2 players.  This Hnefatafl Board was created in the spirit of the original Hnefatafl as it should be played by 2 players on a board.  In Ancient times the board (Tafl) was either made of wood or stone with a grid etched into the surface.  The modern version of this game uses the iPad and it\\s unique capabilities to  make a digital Tafl. Human versus Human strategy with digital benefits!  Game pieces (Tafl-stones) are moved along the board by touching a piece and dragging it to a new square or squares based on Hnefatafl\\s rules. When you capture a Taflstone you move it to your collection bins. Tally up your Conquests, select new board styles and Play again and again!  There are 4 different board designs to play, and 4 sets of taflstones. A quick game guide is included as well as an illustrated game book to get the beginning Hnefatafl player started.  There are sections to keep score on game wins as well.  Brief description of Game Play:  Created over 1600 years ago Hnefatafl is a board game similar to Chess in that the pieces move along a grid. However in Hnefatafl the pieces or Taflstones move vertically and horizontally only.  This is a game for 2 players. Player 1: represents White or the King and his defenders. Player 2: Represents Red or the offensive army.  The Goal for the Defender is to guard the King and not let him get captured and to move to a safe \\u201cburg or corner of the board. Corner squares can only be occupied by the king.  The Goal of the Offensive Army is to attack the King and his Defenders and either capture the King or cut off his corner burgs. Taflstones can only move vertically and horizontally like the Rook in Chess. You can not jump your players or the opponents players. To capture a player you must surround the opposing player on 2 sides. To Capture a King you must surround that piece on 4 sides.  To remove a player from the board drag the player stone into it\\u2019s removal bin to the right of the board.  If the White team succeeds in moving the King to a corner Burg, the White team wins. If The red team captures the king or creates a situation where the King can not move any further the Red team wins.', Developer: 'Nicholas Gressle', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 3584000, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/froodie-frog-free-jump-frogger-froggy-for-ipad/id976959709', Name: 'Froodie: Frog free jump - Frogger Froggy for iPad', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/3a/3f/4d/3a3f4d52-1dee-3c2f-e2ed-8e1fd6e6160e/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Froodie is a classic, retro arcade game Frogger.

Help clean up all the space debris from your universe in this action-packed tap-shooter and reclaim your once beautiful planet Earth.  This is one magnificent space battle you won\\t forget!  Save your beautiful planet Earth now... Before it\\u2019s too late! Of course, we here about many serious environmental issues such as global warming every day but one global problem which has evaded the spot light is the problem of space debris*1. A problem that is increasing every year. That\\s right - in this app, you won\\t be preventing any huge asteroids from crashing down to Earth or battling alien invasions. You will be undoing the harm caused by humankind. So what are you waiting for?  Get on your debris-collector spaceship and make the earth beautiful again.  *1-Space debris is waste revolving around the earth caused by space exploration  - The first shooting game to shine a light on the problem of space debris! - Enjoy the stunning graphics and sound as you fly through the universe. - Not as simple as shooting and destroying the debris, oh no!  - You\\ll have to change the trajectory of the debris, use Earth\\s atmosphere to your advantage and   customize and strengthen the equipment on your spaceship as you progress through the game.  Your mission:  - Destroy all space debris circling our beautiful planet - Challenge the problem of space debris - You can destroy the debris either by firing your laser or by making the debris fall into the atmosphere (the bottom area of the screen).  - Careful though! Some larger pieces of space debris are harder to destroy and need to be hit with the laser multiple times!  Another way to destroy larger pieces of debris is to make them fall into the atmosphere. Once it leaves its orbit, and enters the atmosphere (the bottom area of the screen), the frictional heat will lead to the debris being destroyed. You can even disrupt the trajectory of large debris by firing small shots with your laser.   Laser Attacks  Touch the screen to unleash the laser energy. Some debris cannot be easily destroyed. Larger debris will require multiple shots from your laser cannon. Your laser cannon will overheat  after a while and you\\u2019ll need to wait until it cools before you start using it again.  Watch Out!  Your game will be over when your shield reaches 0%. When your ship is not doing anything (non-operational), your shield will recover little by little.  - Auto Pilot Mode  *Select this option to bring up the menu Use this mode to destroy space debris automatically. If you want to get away from the game for a short while or if you feel like gazing down at the beautiful planet and enjoying the sound, switch this option on. Although the Auto Pilot Mode is good, it is by no means perfect. It does not improvise for every situation, so use at your own risk!  - Tune Up Your Spaceship Accumulate GUP for removing debris and use them to strengthen the equipment on your spaceship. Warning!! When you lose, your spaceship will return to its original state. You can purchase parts to tune up your spaceship at any time.  - Challenge the Secret missions Ready to Challenge the Secret Missions? In addition to the mammoth task of clearing all the space debris, there are 26 hidden missions.  - Get Ready! These are unlocked in a variety of ways.  Missions include defending the Earth from a giant meteorite, encounters with unknown spacecraft and defending against attacks from the unknown spacecraft, Star gliders Careful! If a huge meteorite falls to Earth, your game will be over.  - Help Raise Awareness of Space Debris  What is it? Parts disconnected from the satellites and rockets, peeling paint from degrading space material, as well as debris such as insulation, tools used by astronauts and various other man-made objects. Such debris has become strewn across space. Every year, this problem continues to grow, and we will need to find a solid solution soon.', Developer: 'Happymeal Inc.', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 179470336, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-derp-the-impossible-virtual-pet-game/id979187894', Name: 'My Derp - The Impossible Virtual Pet Game', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/f9/53/6c/f9536c24-84d2-5c44-53f1-0b6a52254985/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Meet your Derp: NOT the cute lovely boring virtual pet you are used to.

GAME RULES:  Men can move forward or sideways one square, capturing by means of a jump, but they cannot move backwards. When a man reaches the back row, it is promoted to a king at the end of the move. Kings may move any number of squares forwards, backwards or sideways, capturing by jumping over any piece and landing on any square within permissible path beyond the captured piece.  Pieces are removed immediately after being jumped. If a jump is possible, it must be done. If several ways of jumping are possible, the one that captures the most pieces must be chosen. No difference between king and man is made during capture; each counts as one piece. If there is more than one way to capture the maximally possible number of pieces, the player may choose which to take. Within a multicapture, turning 180 degrees between two captures is not allowed.  The game ends when a player has no legal move, either because all his pieces are captured or he is completely blocked. The opponent wins the game.', Developer: 'UAB Target Works', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 39909376, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spiral-master-follow-the-pipe/id981877619', Name: 'Spiral Master - Follow The Pipe', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/bc/d0/38/bcd03817-8b90-ca40-a742-032deab9e892/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: '  What A Game!

But dont be misled!  Despite simple rules the game is challenging and requires smart thinking and forseeing the moves of the other player. Whats more, it is a game where the winning depends on your skills and not your luck!  Each match consists of two rounds and the players exchange the cards after the first round. In this way the match result doesnt depend on the luck of the initial draw, but on the strategic skills of the players.  The app contains short tutorial which will help you learn the rules in no time (you may also check the game webpage). The game is based on the Mate game created in 1915 by G.Capellen.  You may choose between two beautiful sets of cards, with chess and classic theme, displayed in native resolution on devices ranging from iPhone 4S to XS Max and iPad Pro. Gentle sound effects will also enhance your game experience.  There are several modes of play:  - Solo game - you may exercise your skills during the game with Albert AI (on three levels of difficulty), - Dual player game - play with your family member or a friend on one device, - Local network game - you may play on two devices via WiFi or Bluetooth, - Game Center game -  last but not least, you may play with your friends or other players around the world via Game Center. In this mode your highest ranking (difference between your points and opponent points in the current match) is stored on the ranking leaderboard in Game Center.  In addition you may set advanced rules for dual player game in app settings before you start the match. Advanced rules allow you to sacrifice single or multiple cards before each players turn.  Sacrificed cards are not used during current round and playing with sacrifices may dramatically change the outcome of the game making it even more challenging and interesting.

Am 30. September 2016 um 19.00 Uhr rennen die Teilnehmenden durch die Strassen von Z\\xfcrich und Lausanne, um dem J\\xe4ger zu entkommen \\u2013 dem Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\\xe9. Am Spielprinzip \\xe4ndert sich nichts: Bleibe am l\\xe4ngsten im Spiel und gewinne das neue Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\\xe9.  DAS MIXED REALITY GAME IM DETAIL Am Freitag, 30. September 2016, ist es soweit: Um 19.00 Uhr beginnt Urban. Hunt. zeitgleich in Lausanne und Z\\xfcrich. Die Jagd dauert ca. zweieinhalb Stunden. Kurz nach dem Start, um ca. 19.15 Uhr, macht sich in jeder Stadt der erste J\\xe4ger auf die Pirsch. Weitere J\\xe4ger folgen im Verlauf des Spiels. \\xdcber GPS werden die Teilnehmenden ausfindig gemacht und verfolgt. Die Teilnehmenden entwischen den J\\xe4gern, indem sie sich zum Beispiel  - m\\xf6glichst weit weg von ihnen aufhalten, - in sogenannten \\xabSafe Houses\\xbb verstecken, - mit Power-ups unsichtbar machen - oder mit Health Packs wieder zu zus\\xe4tzlicher Lebensenergie kommen.  Mit speziellen Power-ups sabotiert man andere Teilnehmende oder den J\\xe4ger, was permanente Spannung ins Spiel bringt.   Je l\\xe4nger die Jagd dauert, desto schwieriger wird es, sich nicht erwischen zu lassen: \\xabNaturkatastrophen\\xbb machen bestimmte Gebiete pl\\xf6tzlich unpassierbar, St\\xfcrme ziehen durch die St\\xe4dte und der Einflussbereich der J\\xe4ger wird immer gr\\xf6sser.  Die richtige Strategie, List und Gl\\xfcck zeichnen den Sieger aus.   Es gilt das Spielprinzip \\xablast man standing\\xbb (der letzte \\xdcbrigbleibende gewinnt): Hast du zum Spielende mehr Lebenspunkte als der \\u201elast man standing\\u201c der anderen Stadt, gewinnst du das brandneue, progressive GLC Coup\\xe9. Als \\u201cunterlegener\\u201d Gewinner erh\\xe4ltst du eine IWC Pilot\\u2019s Watch Chronograph.  Zudem gibt es f\\xfcr die R\\xe4nge zwei bis zehn pro Stadt weitere attraktive Preise zu gewinnen.  SPIELE IM TEAM Gr\\xfcnde in der App ein Team und lade bis zu neun Freunde dazu ein. Im Spiel siehst du so, wo sich deine Team-Mitglieder befinden und in der Team\\xfcbersicht, wie viel Lebensenergie sie noch haben oder wer bereits ausgeschieden ist. Als Team habt ihr noch weitere Vorteile: Loggen sich zum Spielstart alle zehn Mitglieder ein, erhalten alle das Power-Up \\u201cFalle\\u201d zum Start.

Mathematicians discover, explore, and explain the patterns in our world. The key to understanding math is understanding patterns and one of the keys to understanding patterns is understanding the concept of attributes.  Attributes by Math Doodles is a set of 7 problem solving puzzles designed to encourage learners to actively explore, discover, engage and play with the mathematical concepts of attributes and patterns from 7 different scaffolded perspectives.  Each of the 7 activities is designed with 10 scaffolded levels. All puzzles are randomly generated allowing for plenty of replay and practice. Deeper understanding is encouraged by allowing users to choose from a family of 20 different attribute design sets.   THE CHALLENGES:  1. Category Stack- Classify items into stacks according to one attribute family. 2. Combo Table - Represent items in a table according to two attribute families. 3. Find It - Use deductive reasoning to uncover the hidden IT 4. Pattern Sequence - Decipher and complete the pattern sequences 5. Venn - Shared sets.

The game consists of 9 levels of difficulty: easy, normal, hard and insane. Whether which one you choose, you must survive and defeat enemies. Money plays an important role in this game. Money should be used to build turrets in order to defend your base. Creating a turret is easy by selecting you base. Besides building turrets, offensive units are necessary to attack enemies. You make these offensive units by creating an infantry tent first and then selecting your base. During the battle, you pay attention to information about units because some units are good at defeating certain units.  Whenever you knock out units or your units are defeated, you have Experience Points. Experience Points can help you launch a special attack or evolve.

At the beginning, nobody noticed this or paid any attention, but people soon felt that suspicion, hate, war and harm were returning to humanity. More and more parts of the known world were attacked by the evil that nobody could grasp or fight against. When the end seemed close and the world stood on the brink of eternal chaos, the chiefs of all countries gathered in the Council of Nations. In long debates they tried to find a means to fight the evil. But nobody knew what could be done...  The one of the wise men came across some old writings which mentioned a way to fight the evil. A long and dangerous way, because only if the Eight Wonders of the Would were built again could darkness be banished and the evil defeated. The greatest heroes of the past were summoned. The people addressed our friend Bjarni, who at once set out to save humanity from a fatal fortune again with his wife Cyra and their son Mani...  Their destiny, and with it the destiny of all humanity, now lies in your hands. You must solve the mystery surrounding the Eight Wonder of the World with your heroes and banish darkness from the Earth!

He is rushed to Forest Hills Hospital where he is placed in an isolation ward. It is quickly discovered he has Morbusian, a constantly mutating virus that is resistant to all known antivirals. The survival of humanity itself is at stake!  In Infection: Humanitys Last Gasp you are the director of the Department of Plague Control (DPC) field office in New York City. You make the decisions about what parts of the virus to study, which personnel to hire, and what equipment to purchase. Youll soon discover you are working with an eccentric group of scientists who dont always work well together \\u2014 and one very resourceful lab rat named Marvin. As the casualties increase, so does the stress and mistakes made, as you try to complete your vaccine before time runs out for all of mankind!  This strategy game uses simple mechanics in a multitude of combinations to create engaging, deep gameplay as you try to eliminate an evolving virus that could spell the end of the human race. While random events from the Status Reports might throw a wrench in your plans (or occasionally help you out), youll use the Lab Personnel and Equipment youve hired to piece together randomly generated proteins into the different parts of a vaccine, all while managing dwindling funding resources as the Death Toll Track climbs. Each time that your Containment fails you come one step closer to losing this battle, so make sure that you push everyone to their limits before the infection reaches critical levels.  The game features 14 challenging viruses to cure as well as a custom game mode to play with optional game rules.
