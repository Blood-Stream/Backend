Like the international chess, Ouk Chaktrang requires two people to play against each other, but in Cambodia there are always two teams of people participating in the game. This does make every game played even more exciting and entertaining. People, I mean Cambodian men, usually gather to play at a barbershop or Cafe shope for men in their town or village. The object of Chaktrang is also to checkmate the opponent\\u2019s King. In the beginning, who should move first is simply a matter of agreement between the players.

The gameplay is loosely based on the classic board game Checkers, re-imagined as humorous battles between nomadic clans of bloodthirsty pirates. The aim is to simply eradicate all of the enemy pirates by strategically moving your pirates around the cargo net.   GAMEPLAY The aim of the game is to eradicate all of the enemy pirates. Each player takes turns moving their pirates around the net. During each turn, you can either deploy pirates from portholes OR move your pirates by choosing a direction on the compass (all deployed pirates will move one square in the direction the compass is pointing).  Moving a pirate into a square occupied by an enemy pirate will remove the enemy pirate from play. Moving a pirate into an enemy porthole will remove all remaining enemy pirates in that porthole from play (the successful pirate will be reincarnated in the porthole from which he originated).  In a game of wits, cunning, and tactics, it may sometimes be advantageous for players not to move or deploy any pirates. At the start of each turn you can therefore skip your (up to a maximum of three times per stage) by clicking on the relevant icon.  For more information, please refer to the How to Play screens within the app.   PLAYING MODES Scurvy Seadogs includes two different Playing Modes:  1. Quick Play Mode allows players to quickly jump into a 1-on-1 battle against a computer-controlled pirate (ideal for a quick plunder!).  2. Multiplayer Mode allows players to indulge in 1-on-1 games locally on the same device, just like a traditional board game.

Author unknown ***  \\u2026the sun scorched our world and left behind ruins of sand, consumed by war and time. And thus we journeyed into the void, aimlessly wandering for peace and a second chance at life.  The galaxy eventually forgave our sins, sheltered us beneath the warmth of a thousand other suns, and fed us its planetary wonders. But it never once forgot our true nature.  Years of hardships brought widespread discontent among the now scattered human colonies. The sky had given us hope for a new home\\u2026but soon hope turned into greed, greed into hate, and hate into war. The Faction Wars, we called them.   Violent in-fighting pushed us to the galaxy\\u2019s limits, and to ours. They were waiting for us there. We paid no heed to them, the foolish man looking at his finger pointing at the moon. They paid no heed to us, the mighty gods uninterested in the bickering of ants.  Left to our own devices, we reunited once again under two unwavering banners: us, the Terrans and\\u2026us once again, the Alterians. Only humans, divided by an invisible, impossible mountain. Terrans, all so resourceful, raised from sweat and grease yet always gazing at the line beyond the horizon. Alterians\\u2026elegant, advanced, beautiful\\u2026yet so eerily obsessed with the dream of otherworldly perfection.  The last two Houses of Man grew distant, as resentful brothers in a perennial fight over which family path to thread on. Never-ending expansion and gorging of resources, or rejection of human blemishes in pursuit of unachievable divinity? We chose the first and as first we stroke. We ransacked and pillaged whole worlds, and not once did we feel the burden of guilt. And now, Alterians\\u2019 inhuman wrath unfolds before my eyes. As honorable and just as they sure are, never had their reaction been so vicious.   I wonder as I gaze into the sky, knowing that this planet will soon be no more. No matter from which side you\\u2019ll unfold the events to come, I beg you: unite mankind again, annihilate those who stand in the way, and free us from our ancestral shackles. But most of all, I beg you forgiveness for the man I once was.

In order to win a game, you gotta understand a lot about the WIN !! robot, and people in life.  Studying Rock-Paper-Scissors gives you a greater understanding of how gaming relates to human behavior. In that sense, RPS can help you find success in other areas, but only if you have the determination to work hard and think hard \\u2013 not just in RPS, but in every area of your life.  [Think Hand] is your RPS opponent who has some knowledge about human behavior, and it will study you while playing with you. Play with [Think Hand] to train yourself to better understand your opponents in real life.  [Studying Your Opponent]  Because RPS is a game of wits, it\\u2019s crucial to know your opponent. Does he have noticeable tells? What strategy has she used in the past? Does he throw Rock when he\\u2019s angry? Can I make her lose her concentration?  Historically, RPS championships have only admitted players who have won in lesser competitions in order to ensure that every player has data for other competitors to study. The current trends toward open-format competition will give new players an advantage in high-level competitions and possibly break some long-standing RPS \\u201cdynasties.\\u201d  Playing RPS probably won\\u2019t make you rich and famous. Chances are good you won\\u2019t win an Olympic gold medal. And it\\u2019s not likely to improve your physique, maximize your sex appeal, jump-start your career or expand your memory.   RPS is gaming at its most basic, its most fundamental. Take anything away, and it ceases to be a game at all. Every other game, at some level, contains RPS. Like chess or fencing, the rules are simple, but the game itself is as complex as the mind of your opponent.', Developer: 'WMS, Inc', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 18284544, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bees-link-deluxe/id1141893634', Name: 'Bees Link Deluxe', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/25/49/ab/2549ab13-d991-8201-7d3f-c6bc31e9c7b1/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Bees Link Deluxe is a very addictive, beautiful and best connect lines puzzle casual game in the google play!

The players company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas stations fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.   Your vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks.

FEATURES * Rock * Paper  BONUS FEATURES * Scissors  APP HISTORY Rock, Paper, Scissors was invented by Staples, Inc. in 1978 as part of a failed ad campaign. The goal of the campaign was twofold: to make people think that rocks were common office supplies they ought to purchase, and to divert attention from the negative publicity caused by Staples\\u2019 disastrous efforts to start a mail order Sushi-of-the-Month Club. Nowadays, most people barely remember this inauspicious beginning, and Rock, Paper, Scissors has evolved into a powerful tool for resolving disputes between two people or nation-states.  Until recent technological innovations, folks and diplomats had to use their own hands when engaging in Rock, Paper, Scissors-style decision making. The process of contorting one\\u2019s hands into strange shapes that barely resemble a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors was difficult, emotionally draining, and dangerous. Injuries related to Rock, Paper, Scissors peaked in the summer of 1992 and have been on the decline in recent years due to an aggressive response from the CDC, including the multi-million dollar \\u201cJust Say No 2 Ro-Sham-Bo\\u201d marketing effort that discourages kids under the age of 18 from getting started with Rock, Paper, Scissors.   Now, thanks to your friends at Cheerbeard, anyone, even youths, can use the fully technological Rck_Ppr_Szrs iMessage App to safely play this beloved and infinitely useful game. Instead of attempting complicated hand gymnastics, you play by simply tapping your phone\\u2019s screen. You\\u2019ll resolve all manner of disputes, such as which movie to attend or whether or not to allow a country into the Eurozone, without even getting off the toilet. Best of all, you\\u2019ll never break a hand or die by playing Rck_Ppr_Szrs, unless you play it while driving, in which case you will definitely die.  ALTERNATE (AND SOMEWHAT MORE ACCURATE) HISTORY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock\\u2013paper\\u2013scissors  WHAT\\u2019S WITH THE NAME? To make Rock Paper Scissors harder to pronounce and weirder to look at, we\\ve removed all the vowels and connected the words with underscores. Also, it looks more technological. We even threw a \\u201cZ\\u201d in there because why not. Our business plan is to be more successful than Flickr by removing more vowels than they did.

It is regarded as the most similar living game to this common ancestor of all chess variants. There are around two million Thais who can play makruk, while 5000 can play chess. According to former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, Makruk Thai is more strategic than international chess. You have to plan your operations with total care since Makruk Thai can be compared to an anticipated endgame of International Chess.  Rules --------- The Pawn  (called \\u0e40\\u0e1a\\u0e35\\u0e49\\u0e22 bia, a cowry shell, formerly used for money) Moves and captures like a pawn in international chess, but cannot move two steps on the first move and, therefore, cannot be captured en passant. A pawn that reaches the sixth rank is always promoted to a queen (med).  The Queen (called \\u0e40\\u0e21\\u0e47\\u0e14 met), the weakest piece, moves one step in any diagonal direction, like the fers in shatranj, or a cat sword in dai shogi.

Exhausted by the Union siege of Petersburg and Richmond, Lees forces made a last attempt at resistance, attacking and capturing Fort Stedman on March 25.  A rapid counterattack reversed the victory, however, and on the night of April 2nd the Confederate army finally evacuated Richmond.  For most of the next week, the Union army pursued the Confederates along the Appomattox River, exhausting any chance of escape. Grant accepted Lees surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9th.   Sherman accepted Johnstons surrender at Durham Station, North Carolina on April 26th, finally ending the American Civil War, and to slavery in the United States of America.  \\u25cf 7 Mission Tutorial Campaign \\u25cf 5 Mission Twilight Campaign, including the battles of;  - Fort Fisher  - Monroes Crossroads  - Averasboro  - Bentonville  - Fort Stedman \\u25cf 5 Mission Dissolution Campaign, including the battles of;  - Lewis Farm  - White Oak Road  - Selma  - Sutherland Station  - Namozine Church \\u25cf 1 optional hypothetical mission based on a break-out from Richmond! \\u25cf Play all but the tutorial  missions as either Union or Confederate.  \\u25cf 8 Unique Civil War Units:   - Infantry with Smoothbore Muskets.   - Infantry with Rifled Muskets.   - Artillery.   - Generals.   - Dismounted and Mounted Cavalry.   \\u25cf Changeable unit formations and tactics.  \\u25cf Generals can attach to units to increase morale.  \\u25cf More capable Veteran units and unreliable raw units.  \\u25cf 3 difficulty settings.  \\u2028\\u2028\\u25cf Detailed Combat Analysis. \\u2028\\u2028  \\u25cf Flank Attacks\\u2028. \\u2028\\u2028  \\u25cf Map Zoom\\u2028. \\u2028\\u2028  \\u25cf Strategic Movement. \\u2028\\u2028  \\u25cf Universal App (Works on iPhone & iPad)!  \\u25cf Hours of Gameplay!

Before he came to power, getting into America was a simple task, but now, you\\ll have to work harder than ever before. Your role as a player is to represent one of the four countries on each corner of the digital board game. The goal of the game is to be the first player to enter the US. At the beginning of each person\\u2019s turn, they will collect a chance card. Each chance card will give you different opportunities, like go to the nearest Airport, advance 3 spaces, or do not do anything this round. Chance cards can also give you opportunities to collect Skill or Asset cards. You can also use your own asset to buy tickets or borrow. By the time you reach the wall, you will be assessed based on those Skills and Assets to see whether or not you\\u2019re fit to enter the United States. However, this assessment only applies to players who try to enter legally. You can also enter by getting a chance card saying: go through a tunnel to America (or to another point on the map), or take an illegal boat/flight to America. By going in illegally, you will not need to be assessed on your skills and assets. Each way has its own benefits and risks, but either way will give you a chance at entering the US and winning.  ------ Frequently asked questions:  1) Why internet version doesn\\t work: After the player-1 (host) click on Ready, the other players should wait 10 seconds 2) What to do if the applications stops working: Click on the right button next to your home button on your device, it will show you the list of all running applications, click on \\X\\ button to close Immigrant Nightmare application. 3) Where to get support: Please send an email to us at support@immigrantsnightmare.com  Visit us at our Facebook site Immigrants Nightmare Visit us at our website http://www.immigrantsnightmare.com Donate to us at http://www.immigrantsnightmare.com or our current crowd funding https://www.gofundme.com/immigrantnightmare', Developer: 'Mercurial sss', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 55926784, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/match-3-candy-mania-classic/id1162617942', Name: 'Match 3 candy Mania  classic', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/ab/0b/d0/ab0bd052-98df-7374-1417-1ab3467bf5d0/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Match 3 candy Mania  classic is a classic match-3 puzzle game.

Any successful strategy in such a game is some form of pattern recognition, which is a highly developed topic, since it is a fundamental component of both data compression and machine learning. This makes a large set of standard strategies available to players by adapting well-established pattern recognition techniques. The App is designed to help you learn such techniques, and have fun doing so!  You can learn by playing against the computer, after selecting a standard strategy for the computer to use. You can experiment with the relative strengths of different strategies by playing computer versus computer, with a different strategy selected for each side. The App contains elaborate help documentation that describes the standard strategies, with particular emphasis on helping you learn Prediction by Partial Matching, which is one of the most useful pattern recognition techniques.  Most importantly, the App allows you to play against human opponents by connecting your mobile devices over Wi-Fi, so you can apply what you have learned. You can control the level of difficulty by setting the number of rounds per game to be any odd number between 1 and 99. The requirement that it be an odd number leverages an advantage that Matching Pennies has over Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is no possibility of a tie in a game with an odd number of rounds. This makes it a better method for settling disagreements with your friends!  You can speed up games with a large number of rounds, and make them more challenging, by setting a time limit per round. When connected to other players, the time remaining in a round is synchronized among all devices, in order to enforce the time limit fairly.  There are four advanced features that make the game even more interesting and challenging:  Team Play - allows multiple players to mutually connect over Wi-Fi, and form two teams that play against each other.  Strategy Assist - provides additional features in the user interface that help you follow the Prediction by Partial Matching strategy.  Strategy Builder - allows you to create new computer strategies that are variations on the standard strategies. This increases the experimentation you can do to help you form your own unique strategy.  Wagering - allows you to express confidence in your moves by associating a wager with each move, which is a number from 1 to 10. Scoring is adjusted so that a higher wager means a higher reward if you win a round, and a higher penalty if you lose.

Doing jigsaw puzzles develops several functions of the brain simultaneously as a child has fun, learns, and develops his/her abilities to reason, deduce, analyze, sequence, and develop logical thought and problem solving skills. Hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness are also required to complete a jigsaw puzzle.  This is an entertaining app for older children, related to the upcoming Christmas holidays. There are 4 options for the number of pieces of puzzles: 5X5, 6X6, 7X7 and 8X8, as well as 40 different pictures to choose from. There is a magnifying glass function to help the player with finding the pieces. Tapping on the magnifying glass presents the player with the picture being worked on.

There are five heroes, nine kinds of potions, eleven conscripts and five kinds of  elite arms.  Introduction of the painting style and design The art of Selnasaga is a little special. Our game theme is RPG of European and American style, thus we combined popular flat profile design with traditional realistic hand-drawn design. As for a mobile game, Gen 3D animation is not available. And oversimple style is not in accordance with our expectation of game experience. Therefore, after a series of coordination and exploration, we combined realistic style with Q version, creating current graphic look. On the one hand, we use special feelings created by strokes to interpret UI and roles. On the other hand, we use generalization pattern to simplify the combat scenes as much as possible.  Team introduction Fantacell is a team composed of aspiring and minded developers and designers. The team currently has three people, including two programmers and one designer. Constant discussion and intertwined thoughts drove us to complete the product. We are committed to the exploitation of games and apps that we like and users want to play.

The objective of the game is to form lines vertically and/or horizontally on the board using the wooden block pieces while avoiding obstacles.  Each time you form a line, the existing blocks within that column or row disappear.  The wooden block pieces can be rotated by tapping on them and can be placed on the board by dragging them with your finger.  The obstacles appear in the form of tree stumps. These stumps appear at random times during the game and must be placed on the board as well.   Since the stumps serve as obstacles, they prevent you from forming lines in columns and rows where they are placed.  So how can you continue to form lines in the game while these obstacles continue to appear?  Well, also randomly, the game provides you with matches which come in different shapes and sizes. These matches are the only way to get rid of these tree stumps so you must use the matches wisely.  While the game may seem easy in the beginning, it gets more and more challenging as the board fills up. Your goal is to hang in the game as long as you can while trying to score high.  The game is challenging, fun and addictive.   It features four difficulty levels and those levels are:  Easy: features a 12x12 grid.  Medium: features a 10x10 grid.  Hard: features a 8x8 grid.  Insane: features a 6x6 grid.

Start building your transport empire by creating taxi routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic.   The players company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the taxis, as the taxis require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of taxi models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas stations fuel supply to unlock newer vehicle models. Each taxi route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 taxi stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your taxi stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.   Your vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your cars, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks.   Key game features:  - transport passengers between taxi stations  - a variety of taxi models  - upgrade stations to large taxi hubs - upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types  - beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings - build road network freely  - NO IN APP options - build traffic lights to each junction - automatic breakdown generation - automatic road crack generation - various demolishing tools  The developers notes: If you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.
