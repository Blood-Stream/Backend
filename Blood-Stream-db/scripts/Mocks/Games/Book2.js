The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.  The main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted S. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.  When moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponents pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to jump over an opponent if it isnt part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.  Through symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If ones piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.  Senet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.

Play is adjustable: 2-4 players (any of which can be computer players), different board sizes, a variable number of randomly placed blocking squares, player colors,  and whether piece placement is by dragging or selection.","Developer":"Zentropy Software","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":1530880,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/all-you-can-eat/id291723451","Name":"All You Can Eat","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/36/63/81/366381d1-4a44-78fb-20e9-e9f06ba6abe9/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"All You Can Eat is a very enjoyable game.

PaintBall 2 is the successor of our best seller, original award winning game, developed in a way that we can guarantee it will keep you hours and hours on your phone. What is paintball? Its not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and youll get hooked.  \\u2022 Game Objective: You have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.  \\u2022 Tips: Using the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word PaintBall on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!  \\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose. \\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups. \\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning! \\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.

The levels are filled with dirt which can be tunneled through simply by moving through it. This creates empty space. Emerald and diamonds can be collected by moving into them. Diamonds are with 3x as Emeralds.  Rocks and gems can rest on dirt, walls (only indestructible and magic walls), or other rocks and gems, but once these are removed, they will fall down. This is sometimes useful, as you can drop things on top of monsters roaming the levels. Some destroyed monsters drop gems necessary to achieve the necessary number to complete the level.  Or they may drop other pieces, such as explosives or keys to help you solve the puzzles.  Or control the wind direction.  There are dozens of creatures to interact with.

The game is easy to get into as well as get out of again. There is no troublesome saving or loading \\u2013 just end the game (by pressing the home button on the iPhone) and start exactly where you left off next time you turn it on.  Pebbles is flexible! Pebbles has got everything: from a quick game here and there to tricky challenges.  The easier levels don\\u2019t require too much sweat; however, they are not trivial and still a lot of fun. The higher levels of difficulty get pretty tricky, though. Just the right thing when you\\u2019re in the mood to get that gray matter working.   Pebbles is pretty and sounds cute! What\\u2019s more, Pebbles is supported by adorable visual effects (three pebble designs to choose from) and the cutest sounds.   How does Pebbles work?  The basic principle of the game is irresistibly easy: from the edge, you throw a pebble into a square playing field. When one stone lands on another of the same color, this stone as well as all bordering stones of the same color disappear. The goal is, of course, to empty the field \\u2013 so far, so good.    Yet, this simple concept leads to surprisingly challenging functions, and the variety of strategic possibilities make Pebbles an absorbing game.   A shelf above the playing field shows which stone is going to come next. Knowing which stone is going to follow is a deciding factor in the game\\u2019s strategy.   Choosing the sequence of the moves with care is also very important: a well positioned pebble can do more than just eliminate others; it can also be the basis for up coming moves, just as a badly positioned pebble can prove to be terribly obstructive.    The level of difficulty increases with the number of pebbles that are in the playing field at the start of a game as well as the number of different colors.","Developer":"Objective Development","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":10136576,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airtycoon-airline-management/id313478124","Name":"AirTycoon - Airline Management","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/aa/00/3f/aa003f64-410d-1ed5-1593-3de81d55e503/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"*  Air Tycoon - Realistic management simulation game.

You can purchase upgrade modules via in App Purchase.  (C) 1986-2011, Rolf-Dieter Klein, Martin Ulrich, Munich, Bremen, Germany  Ports of Call has a long tradition  the first version was released on the Amiga 1986 with other versions following.  Now the classic game is getting mobil. We kept the classic interface and design by intention, as this was a user request since years - an update for full screen support will follow soon, also other versions are on our wish and todo list.  A Background on Tramp Shipping:  The traffic of goods by sea is organized  in accordance with international agreements and contracts between individual countries.  About 80% of the goods (called cargo volume) transported between two countries is handled by ships registered under the flags of the countries concerned. The remaining 20% are  open to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called tramp ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.  The Object of the Game  Each player founds his own shipping  company, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market. Then the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.  After unloading his cargo, the captain  is credited with the agreed payment. Then he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.  A player\\s chances of success improve  the more he knows about international  shipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.  But the game is not a pure economic game,  also a ship simulator is integrated, and the captain can steer his ship manually, either if necessary, or to save money and get a good status.  In summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind:  Software with Hard Facts.   latest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example). To avoid the burglar, visit your office in a regular interval.     homepage: www.portsofcall.de support: www.rdkleinforum.de","Developer":"Dipl.-Ing.

You control a skeleton wizard who is in charge of protecting the skull tower from human invasion. With each human kill of enemy warriors, you gain soul points which can be used to research for new spells or repair your tower.  To send your enemies to their deaths, touch the skull tower and drag a line towards the enemies to send a lightning towards them so that they will be electrified before they reach the skull tower.  Your mana bar will increase similarly like your soul points when the number of enemies you killed increases. However,if more enemies hit on the skull tower, the health bar of the tower will decrease to a point it will be destroyed to ground. Your mission is to prevent that from happening!  After you killed all the enemies on the level, you are given a resting time where you can either upgrade your existing spells or research new spells. You can also exchange all your soul points to repair your skull tower.    Spells to research or upgrade:  - Mana capacity - this is the ability to cast your spells. If you run out of mana, you cannot cast any more spells and your tower will be in danger.   - Chain lightning damage - you can increase your damage of this spell to greater heights.  - Hellfire - a fire from the hell that will burn your enemies to ashes. It works by drawing a circle over the affected area on the screen. The hellfire will ignite and set enemies within the chosen area on fire.  - Frozen Touch - this spell will freeze your enemies and you can increase the duration for which they are frozen to delay time.  It works by double tapping the enemies to freeze them. After being frozen, the enemies cannot move or attack the skull tower.  Addition character to summon:  - Skeleton Archer - He will attack enemies automatically without you touching the screen. You can increase his level in the game to make him stronger by redeeming your soul points to upgrade his level.

Very few, unless you\\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive?

The game is mesmerizing\\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \\u2026 and DodgeDot\\u2122 tops the list\\u201d  \\u201cI\\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\\u2019s such a great game that\\u2019s hard to put down\\u201d  \\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\\u201d  \\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \\u2026worth way more than you\\u2019re payin\\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\\u2019t pass it up!\\u201d  \\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\\u2122.\\u201d  Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\\t stop playing.    Excellent game. Entire family from 3 to 83 loves it  This may be the winner on my list of \\Most addictive games for the iPad.\\ My daughter is addicted, I\\m addicted and my mother is addicted! Love it, love it love it  Deceivingly simple at first, and gets challenging pretty soon.

The cards have categories featuring data about classic computers, compete against your opponent by selecting the best category from the following categories:  Release Date,  Coolness, CPU, Ram, Hard Disk Size, Cost New.  The release date category wins (Trumps) when it is the oldest, all other categories win (Trumps) when they are the highest value.  The player with the winning value (The Top Trump) for the category selected wins the 2 cards and places them at the bottom off their pile of cards. In the event of a draw both the cards of the player and opponent are added into the draw-pot. The winner of the next round wins all of the cards in the draw-pot as well as the top card from each player.   The following games are available to play:  One Player - The player plays against the computer, winning when he trumps the computer and takes all the cards.  Two Player - Two people play passing the device between each other. The winner must take all the other players cards.  Points Game - The Player plays against the computer and is awarded points for winning dependent on the category selected. Points are displayed in the red circles next to each category button. The higher the chance of winning the lower the points. To get a high score you must risk gambling on a category with a small chance of winning. Try playing for a draw as both players points are added into a draw-pot, whoever wins the next hand is awarded all the points in the draw-pot. Winning 5 consecutive hands will result in the points available being doubled (the points in the red circle are doubled). Losing a hand will return all points values back to their original values. The game ends when all the computers cards have been taken.  The pack of Cards can be viewed Via the View Cards Menu option.

Answer: Don\\u2019t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu.   Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it?  Answer: When saved games can\\u2019t be automatically restored, we\\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter \\u201eCatanWarp*\\u201c (* = 1\\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well.   Question: Are dice rolls really random?  Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!   ***** Questions or suggestions for improvements:  Mail to ios@usm.de  We are looking forward to your feedback!

The galaxy is being overrun by an invading horde of enemies know as Swarmers. The swarmers are fast and ferocious and attacks in swarms, hence their name. The swarmers have decimated the entire fleet of warships leaving the inhabited planets and remaining spaces stations defenseless.   Having been on an extensive intelligence mission, your ship is the last of the fleet. You have been ordered back to defend what is left and drive the swarmers back.   Your ship, the first of its kind, is faster and more powerful that those in the destroyed fleet and so you stand a chance of victory if you can master the swarmer\\s tactics.  You ship is equipped with three weapons; a laser bank, torpedos and the Extirpator and a protective energy shield. Fully automated, you ship is ready for battle. It\\s up to you to save the galaxy.  To successfully complete you mission you must destroy all swarmers and protect at least two (2) space stations and two (2) planets from destruction without yourself being destroyed. Your ship is destroyed if the energy level or life support levels reach zero.   -----------------------------------------  Galaxy Trek is a turn-based strategy game, similar in concept to the old mainframe trek game. The galaxy is broken into 64 quadrants arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each quadrant is broken down into 64 sectors arranged in an 8x8 grid. You maneuver your ship across the galaxy, destroying swarmers before they can destroy inhabited planets and space stations.   The game is played turn-by-turn. That is, you play your turn in which you can complete a set of actions, then the swarmers have their turn in which their ships will perform a countering set of actions. This continues until one side is victorious.  You will be ranked on your performance throughout the mission.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle Plus is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. To try before you buy, see our free, ad-supported Pinochle app. If you prefer, our other pinochle app with no advertising, Pinochle Gold, has more card backs and tabletops to choose from, and adds support for several languages.  Pinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.  In this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).  BIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealers left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.  MELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).  TRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.  SCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his teams total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.","Developer":"fishdog.net","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":43512832,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solo-noble-peg-solitaire-free/id339348074","Name":"Solo Noble - Peg Solitaire - Free","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/5d/67/59/5d6759f6-4970-0fc1-e2a4-d7e19b738a17/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Now play the game played by the European nobles in the court of Louis XIV back in 17th century on your iPhone or iPod Touch.

Please see below for directions.  Optia is a beautiful, immersive physics game about reflected light. You must activate all targets in each level with a laser beam, powering the transition to the next.  Fortunately, your puzzle-solving instincts come in handy here! Using a clever assortment of mirrors, you can reflect a beam in any direction, split it into two separate beams (or four, or eight, or sixteen...), and if you must, sacrifice your own laser to clear a path to that last target.  And Optia doesnt end there! After cutting your teeth on the main campaign, you can create your own levels and upload them for others to play.  With 100 main levels, more than one thousand user-created levels, and a polished ecosystem for creating, playing, and rating new levels, you never really need to stop playing Optia. And you can decide if thats a good thing.  - Featured in Apples New & Noteworthy - Winner of Applied Arts Magazine Award for Game Design  ----------------  TIPS & TRICKS  - To sync levels across devices, unlock the level editor by completing 30 levels.

It helps understand chess, and eventually become better at the game through learning how to read the board.  Crazy Chess is a derivative of Fischer Random Chess and Really Bad Chess. On the BA.net Crazy Chess version the second line of pieces is generated at random. With more chances of higher weight pieces.  You can get a new board every time you reload the app! Also the computer player is a bit unluckier when getting chess pieces. Have fun!  Game Design The game is fast and exciting as you start right into the middle game.  Castling is done by moving the king, rook moves automatically.  When swapping sides the computer makes its move instantly (since it\\s its turn) so you may be disoriented at first and not notice it.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.  Pinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.  In this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).  BIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealers left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.  MELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).  TRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.  SCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his teams total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.","Developer":"fishdog.net","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":50140160,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-adventure/id351214816","Name":"Space Adventure","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/59/4c/40/594c400d-7ed0-58cf-a246-e0ddb58a3fd1/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Travelling in space might be dangerous, as you can encounter aggressive forms of life that seek to destroy you.

The matriarch is dying, and murder is in the air - whoever survives this night will walk away with a fortune!  In this nasty, conniving, and thoroughly awful multiplayer strategy game, players take on the role of one of the four nobles trying to kill off the others.  Each noble is surrounded by a retinue of leeches, hangers-ons, and sycophants who can be bent to your will through the use of blackmail, flattery, or intimidation.  Your goal is to gain influence over these subordinates, give one of them a weapon, and send them over amidst your opponents.  If you have enough influence over the subordinates, and they have a weapon, they\\ll kill that noble for you, and you\e one corpse closer to winning the game!  The game is played in a turn-based fashion, using an innovative pass the phone style.  Each player takes a turn on the device, and then hands it to the next player to take their turn.  The device is handed around between players until one of them wins.  Audio cues triggered during play give other players clues as to what the current player might be doing, which adds to the intrigue.  This game may be played by 2 to 4 players, however, because it\\s all played on the same device, you only need one copy of the game to play with your friends.  The casual nature of the game makes it an excellent diversion to play while doing other things - hanging out, watching television, on road trips, waiting for the movie to start, etc.  It\\s a fun game to just pull out and run when you want something casual that engages your friends.  The original version of this game was created for the 2010 Global Game Jam by a team of 4 people.  This version is a cleaned-up and improved version with new features.  FEATURES:    *  Multiplayer casual strategy for 2-4 players.   *  Blackmail, flatter, and intimidate your subordinates to murder your rivals.   *  Fun, innovative gameplay that evokes Machiavellian intrigue.   *  Casual gameplay makes it ideal for parties, lunch breaks, or just when hanging out.","Developer":"Barking Dog Interactive","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":19125248,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/laser-chess/id355022891","Name":"Laser Chess","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/8a/2c/2f/8a2c2ffb-e0c6-060d-0f33-bc7158e21aed/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Laser Chess is a classic chess game with lasers and mirrored pieces.

It provides two random generators/eliminators and one manual picker. The first generator is the Straight  Eliminator - any team has the same probability to be selected (it does not matter if team has a seed #1 or #16).  The second generator is the Weighted Eliminator - a team gets a weight according its seed. As an example - team A with a seed #1 plays team B with a seed #16 in the first round. In this case the team A is entered into the picker drum 16 times and team B only once. Similarly, team C seed #5 plays team #12 - thus team C is entered 12 times and opponent team D 5 times.  Both these generators runs in the automatic mode - teams are fed into the picker drum according the draw (Round1, Round2, Sweet16, Elite8, Final4, Final). Results are kept in the database and prior the next run those results are cleared automatically.  The manual picker feeds teams according the draw but selection of the winner is up to you.  Please note the following: 1. The real draw will be available a day after Monday Selection (for 2017 it is March 13) and will be automatically downloaded when you open the App. 2. This App is not for 2017 draw only. It can be reuse in the coming years 2018, 2019,\\u2026 but only for current size of 64 teams. 3.

You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game.   Each player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized.   If the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player\\s claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.  Refer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game.   As few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it. If you draw a winning or kong tile, push multiple tiles forward to show your hand.     You can move and rearrange the tiles at will.  To have them sorted automatically, do a hoizontal swipe above your hand.  On iPad, it supports layout on the larger screen in both portrait and landscape modes.  A convenient feature, especially for single handheld play on the iPhone, is you can also click on the hand button to claim a tile or declare a win.  You can adjust the game speed and sound.  You can also control that hands be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand.  Choose  Align discarded tiles to line discarded tiles neatly, else discarded tiles are spinned and placed randomly.  You can choose to play flower and season tiles.  You can change the the color of the background and tiles, or use a picture as the game background.   Multitask switching on supported iOS. Game is paused when you switch away from the App and automatically resumed when you return.

Most brain-teasing games are designed with a certain level of difficulty \\u2013 either it is too easy for adults, like the 10-piece jigsaw puzzles, or too difficult, like the Rubiks Cube that very few can solve.  Most players either lose interest because it is too easy or feel frustrated because it is too difficult to solve.    Are you looking for a puzzle game that anyone can play, but still offers plenty to master? Look no further than LONPOS, it is a fantastic award winning game that has received a huge amount of attention around the world.  LONPOS is the result of many years of research and development to create a fun, enjoyable and challenging brain exercise game for all ages.    Beware, LONPOS is a very addictive game, so it\\u2019s the perfect game to return to again and again.  Play it against yourself or have great fun when two or more players compete with each other to see who can finish a game first.   LONPOS is an innovative game that enhances hand-eye coordination, improves cognitive logic skills, and trains short-term memory.  Playing the LONPOS is like doing a Yoga exercise with your brain.  It tickles your brain with an easy level puzzle that you can solve in a minute.  But don\\u2019t be fooled \\u2013 it is just a warm up exercise to prepare you for more challenging puzzles ahead.  When you play the more challenging level puzzles, it will give your brain a good stretch for hours, even days.  But when you complete the puzzle, you will feel like a genius with a fantastic sense of achievement and youre ready to move onto the next puzzle.   LONPOS consists of 12 building blocks (known as Pentominoes), each unique in shape and color.  Each Pentomino can be rotated in 90\\xb0 intervals or can be flipped in 180\\xb0 to create a mirror image. Each puzzle revolves around a rectangular game board of 55 spaces. The goal is to place all Pentominoes into the game board to occupy all 55 spaces.  That sounds easy doesn\\u2019t it?  Don\\u2019t be fooled!  Not every puzzle you set out will have a unique answer and each new puzzle will be a new challenges.

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.  In Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least thats what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.  The goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.  A status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you  Features:  - Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet. - Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon. - Destroyable 3D landscape. - Perspective or overhead view. - Three difficulty settings. - Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor. - Save / Resume game.

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.  In Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least thats what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.  The goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.  A status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.  Features:  - Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet. - Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon. - Destroyable 3D landscape. - Perspective or overhead view. - Three difficulty settings. - Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor. - Save / Resume game.  This is the free Lite version with ads and limited supplies.  Please buy the full version Tank Ace 1944 HD for truck resupply during the game.  Note: RESETgame does not condone invasion of other countries and cannot accept liability for such an event.","Developer":"RESETgame","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":16104448,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pitch/id366561888","Name":"Pitch","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/10/38/a1/1038a189-f994-055c-faf7-6078db1d03a8/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Customize how you play Pitch, including options to play 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 13 point!

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon.  Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.  Earning its reputation as the thinking mans dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation.  Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.  Each player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability.  Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.  Depending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations).  More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief.  Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.  Unlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon.  There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.  Oubliette is challenging, but forgiving.  New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters.  In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time!  Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips.  If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again.  The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.  If you are up to the challenge, Oubliette is free to download and play.  Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise.  And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.  Onward to Glory!","Developer":"GabySoft","Age_Rating":"9+","Size":61472768,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/000xxx/id376659240","Name":"000XXX","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/b2/26/90/b2269025-e31a-87a8-1e3c-3e262fe55a2b/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"A beautiful new variant of the well-known Tic Tac Toe, three in a row game.

Peppers is unlike any other match-three on the market today.  We took the match-three concept and raised it to the next level.    If you enjoy games like, Bejeweled 2, Jewel Quest, Parking Lot, and Falling Gems, then you will love Peppers.  Features:  * Four game modes and eight ways to play. * Full Version has twenty unique levels. * Beautiful graphics and animation. * Stores top ten scores with statistics. * Jump to any unlocked level. * Listen to your own music or jam with ours.  * Unlock achievement awards. * Uses the accelerometer. * Supports iOS 4 multitasking. * Battery friendly.  How to Play:  In each game, its not just a race against time; one must score enough points in the current level to unlock the next level.  The time allotted for each level will remain the same; however, as each level gets harder the points necessary to unlock the next level will be reduced.  The game will end if the timer runs out and the next level has not been unlocked.  Looking for game hints?  There are none!  Each game will begin with three pepper shakers which are displayed at the top of the screen.  As progress is made through the twenty unique levels the game will get more challenging.  Simply shake or touch the pepper shakers to randomly rearrange the peppers.  Since there are only three pepper shakers per game use them wisely because chances are they will be needed later on.  If no mores are possible one of three things will happen.  If the next level was unlocked then it will begin.  If not and there are still pepper shakers available then one will be used to continue, otherwise the game will end.  On Fire:  Unlike traditional match-three games in which only two game pieces swap places, in Peppers entire rows and columns are moved to match three or more peppers.  Once three or more matching peppers are lined up they, along with any adjacent peppers, will begin to shake.    Continue moving rows and columns to get as many peppers shaking.  Score big points by matching as many peppers as possible.  Keep in mind peppers adjacent to any shaking pepper will also begin to shake.  Rows and columns with any shaking peppers can still be moved around as long as the move results in one or more peppers shaking  In every other level there will be a locked pepper.  A row with a locked pepper cannot be moved up or down, likewise, a column with a locked pepper cannot be moved left or right.  Score extra points by removing locked peppers.  Once satisfied, press the Fire button.    Visit www.peppersthegame.com for additional game hints, screenshots, and videos.

It was released for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 in 1987. It was published in the United Kingdom by Argus Press Software and re-released in Spain by Mind Games Espana S.A. The player takes the control of the human side in a war against the mysterious Insignian race. All of the warfare is carried out by enormous military robots. The player controls a flying machine which can fly over any part of the play-area. The player must build robots and give them orders to attack Insignian robots and capture neutral or enemy factories to increase production and thus aid the war effort. The ultimate objective is to capture all the enemy bases and thus win the war. Everything takes place in real-time with the action being ongoing rather than turn-based. Because the players view of the battlefield is limited to where their flying-machine is, much of the front-line fighting is left to the machines whilst the player concentrates on building more robots. The game is displayed in forced-perspective isometric graphics.","Developer":"Aleksejs Voloviks","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":4241408,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/legends-of-elendria-the-frozen-maiden/id382783275","Name":"Legends of Elendria: The Frozen Maiden","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/65/5c/3f/655c3f95-7061-4b2e-06c9-ed3076eabc6b/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Promoting our new Collectible Card Game:  [Cabals: The Card Game] Check it out, its Legendary!

IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a general determination of the capacity of individuals to think and reason.  An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.  The application IQ Test: Calculate your IQ includes:  *A free test of 10 questions : This 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.  *Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid) The tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation. You will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence. This report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).  *A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid) The test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.  It will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension. This test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist.  It includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\\s actual age right at the start of the test.   *The IQ Expert challenge : (paid) This test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110)  The expert version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests.  This IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests.   How to take this test: 1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed. 2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted. 3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation. 4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more reasonable to you. 5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test.  It has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.  What our users say:  Hi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\\m very satisfied with the results. I\\m really happy that I came off so intelligently!  I feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides.

If we add a one-level drop to a four-level drop, which can cause to burst four splashing drops and splash to four directions., and each drop met by splashing drop will be upgraded, and so on. - Operating skills:     TEN DROPS places emphasis on using the least drops to create the largest chain reaction.     We should try to let splashing drops to hit four-level (round) drops and make it disappear.     The system will reward us one one-level drop (one touch opportunity) if we can clear up three four-level drops by one click.     The system will rewards us two one-level drops (two times touch opportunities) if we clear up six four-level drops, and like this.     Passing one stage each time players can be rewarded one one-level drop.

Description: This is the funniest and most addictive game you\\ll ever play - hilarious fun that you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little blighters with a bad attitude!  In other words Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.  As commander, it\\s your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.  Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\\ hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the Rope or Parachute, to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\\s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).   * Hilarious and devastating turn based combat for up to 8 players * Local multiplayer with optional AI opponents * Battle on an infinite number of randomly generated maps with over 31 environments, or choose from 48 set image maps * Utilise 55 (and counting) devastating weapons!

Trek Quest HD not only captures the excitement and game play features of the original Super Star Trek console game, but brings it into the 21st century with updated graphics and the same modern themes you see in sci-fi movies. \\xa0Click ...More to learn why you should download this App today!  You are commander of the U.S.S. Protector, and it is your mission to defend the galaxy against the corrupt forces of the Krygons invasion fleet. The entire galaxy is your battlefield; which is divided off into 64 numbered quadrants. There are 8 rows of 8 to help you distinguish which aliens are in which quadrants, and which ones you need to focus on. However you only need to concern yourself with those intruders that inhabit the quadrant that you are patrolling.   Trek Quest HD features: * Accurate re-creation of the classic Super Star Trek computer game * Easy to use controls * Engaging game play * Three levels of play * Trainee mode for learning the basics  Use the phaser and photon torpedo weapons in your arsenal to help you gain control over your diabolical enemy. Use your deflector shields to ward off attacks; and survey the battlefield with your long range and short range scanners. You can also use a galaxy map, or star chart, to get a feel for what lays ahead of you.  Trek Quest HD includes a trainee section and 3 increasingly difficult levels of play. The difference between the levels is the number of enemy craft which increase with the rank you select. The starting energy level of your ship and the remaining playing time also decrease as you progress from one level to the next. The trainee helps you learn the navigation of your ship, and how to operate the weapon systems. In this mode you start out nice and easy, with only one enemy and one star base in each quadrant. After you complete each quadrant, that sector will turn blue so you will know which areas you\\ve already conquered.  Move about under warp drive or impulse power but be aware that the enemy is lurking, waiting to attack you. When your ship gets hit, your equipment may sustain damage. If that happens, the damage reports screens show the estimated time needed to repair your craft. If your rig becomes disabled, you can take a break at a star base and rest while your repairs are being taken care of.  Infinite space brings infinite possibilities for mass destruction, so it\\s important to travel carefully into the cosmos. Download Trek Quest HD now, because the Krygons are coming and you may be the galaxy\\s only hope.

The flick mechanic works just like it does in real life (try it!): Point a pencil straight down onto some paper, holding it by the top with just one finger. While pressing down firmly, slowly tilt the top of the pencil - beyond a critical angle the tip will suddenly slip away leaving a line drawn on the paper. This line determines your move or shot on the battlefield.  Lead Wars simulates this mechanic using the touch-screen as if you\e touching the top of a real pencil.

Designed to be easy enough for the casual gamer to jump right in, yet deep enough to challenge the true battle strategist.  Position your forces in cunning battle formations. Execute your plan by individually controlling each fighter in the battle. Control multiple fighters simultaneously and use them to surround and defeat stronger adversaries. Set traps for enemy soldiers by using decoys to lure your enemys attention away from a target. Apply special powers to your warriors at strategic moments to gain the final advantage. Will you achieve victory by destroying all of the Ocran warriors, or will the battle be won by setting fire to the Ocran castle? The choice is yours.  As the game advances and you unlock new levels, video animations introduce you to new warriors with different strengths and abilities.  You can decide how to use these new warriors in your arsenal and lead your army against the enemy in foreign lands as you progress through the campaign.  Your enemy will constantly be learning and reenforcing their army and castles. A successful strategy on one level may utterly fail on another if your enemy has learned your tactics. If you get frustrated and cant beat a level, go to www.touchofcombat.com to see hints and spoilers for how to win.  Do you possess the skill and strategy to lead your warriors to victory?","Developer":"KrookedHook Media","Age_Rating":"12+","Size":15812315,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/free-tiles-slider-puzzle-for-kids-picture-slider/id393567084","Name":"Free Tiles Slider Puzzle For Kids(Picture Slider)","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/7a/87/36/7a8736a5-b8f7-23ee-6d6f-7672a29b73d3/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"K-Slider Free is a classic tile slider puzzle, supporting 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 puzzle mode.

This is the basis that CrossPix is based upon, these puzzles are also known as Paint by Numbers, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Picross, Prisma Pixels, Hanjie and many others.  We have added a little more to the art of these puzzles, in order to solve all puzzles you must first unlock them with CM Points, which, can be earned by solving puzzles, the more complex the puzzle the more points it takes to unlock but also the more it points you will earn.

As a commander of a military facility you are ordered to destroy an enemy base. This is not an easy task as the capabilities of the enemy base are matching the capabilities of your base.

The battle between you and your enemy is turn based but the turns are evaluated simultaneously. Every turn begins with a dice roll. The value of the dice represents the amount of action points added to your action point pool. You can then use your action points to fire from and/or repair any of your 3 towers situated in your base. You can also use one of the protocols (battle cards). After spending any amount of you action points, you must end your turn before the turn time runs out. When you and your enemy finished your turns, the turns will be evaluated and you can inspect the battle in real time.

The first player symbolizes the Yin, the second player symbolizes the Yang   -It is played on an 8x8 board of 64 squares. There are 64 Taijitu pieces, colored black for player representing Yin and gold for the player representing Yang.   - In the basic game, the board is set up initially with two Taijitu pieces for each player. The advanced games (Challenge and Master) have more pieces on the initial board)   - Yang (black Taijitu) makes the first moved. Players are then taking alternate turns.   - When making your move, you can change faith by forcing pieces on the board to change from Yin to Yang or Yang to Yin.   - Goal of the game is, once all the pieces are placed to have more pieces than your opponent on the board.   - At each turn a player must place a Taijitu piece with their color face up on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponents Taijitu piece, such that one or  more straight lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) are formed from the newly placed disc, through one or more of the opponents discs and up to other Taijitu pieces of their own color already  on the board. All the intervening Taijitu pieces of the opponents color are flipped to the faith (Yin/Yang) of the newly laid Taijitu piece.   -Taijitu pieces may be flipped from one faith to the other but once played are not moved from one square to another or removed from the board.   - Players may not pass unless there is no valid move available to them in which case they must pass.   -Play continues until neither player is able to move, usually when all 64 squares have been played.   - The player with most piece of their faith wins    History   In Chinese philosophy, the concept of yin yang, normally  referred to in the West as yin and yang) is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other  in turn. The concept lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of  different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (tai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung) and of I Ching divination. Many natural dualities \\u2014 e.g. dark and light,  female and male, low and high, cold and hot \\u2014 are thought of as manifestations of yin and yang (respectively).  Yin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly  in particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. The concept of yin and yang is often symbolized by various forms of the Taijitu symbol, for which it is probably best known in western cultures.  There is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to good and evil (not respectively). However, Taoist philosophy generally discounts good/bad distinctions and other  dichotomous moral judgments, in preference to the idea of balance. Confucianism (most notably the philosophy of D. Zhongshu, circa the second century BCE) did attach a moral dimension to the idea  of yin and yang, but the modern sense of the term largely stems from Buddhist adaptations of Taoist philosophy.   ----------------------  This game is enabled for GameCenter and allows you to play against other players through GameCenter.","Developer":"Uwe Meier","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":24873984,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galaxy-trek-for-ipad/id406516620","Name":"Galaxy Trek for iPad","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/24/cb/77/24cb7784-a898-4b46-b25c-dcf0a89c8856/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"The galaxy is being overrun by an invading horde of enemies know as Swarmers. The swarmers are fast and ferocious and attacks in swarms, hence their name. The swarmers have decimated the entire fleet of warships leaving the inhabited planets and remaining spaces stations defenseless.  Having been on an extensive intelligence mission, your ship is the last of the fleet. You have been ordered back to defend what is left and drive the swarmers back.  Your ship, the first of its kind, is faster and more powerful that those in the destroyed fleet and so you stand a chance of victory if you can master the swarmer\\s tactics. You ship is equipped with three weapons; a laser bank, torpedos and the Extirpator and a protective energy shield. Fully automated, you ship is ready for battle. It\\s up to you to save the galaxy.  To successfully complete your mission you must destroy all swarmers and protect at least two (2) space stations and two (2) planets from destruction without yourself being destroyed. Your ship is destroyed if the energy level or life support levels reach zero.  -----------------------------------------  Galaxy Trek is a turn-based strategy game, similar in concept to the old mainframe trek game. The galaxy is broken into 64 quadrants arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each quadrant is broken down into 64 sectors arranged in an 8x8 grid. You maneuver your ship across the galaxy, destroying swarmers before they can destroy inhabited planets and space stations.  The game is played turn-by-turn. That is, you play your turn in which you can complete a set of actions, then the swarmers have their turn in which their ships will perform a countering set of actions. This continues until one side is victorious.  You will be ranked on your performance throughout the mission.

Think of a Butterfly like a King in Chess that is captured when it has pieces all around it.  In your turn you can either put a new piece in the board or move one of your existing ones. New pieces can only enter in contact with your own pieces.  You have a limited quantity of pieces, and they all move differently, so you have to think very carefully your move in order to use them wisely and outsmart your opponent!  Finally, but most important of all: all pieces in the game should make one big group at all times, regardless of their owner. This rule can be used at your advantage to block your enemy\\s pieces and prevent them from moving.  Rule sets vary the amount of pieces players have and the way they move.","Developer":"Raul Ignacio Verano","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":40961352,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hack-run/id407678003","Name":"Hack RUN","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/8d/23/19/8d231963-3002-bb5a-0b13-bed6ff8852d2/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Ever wanted to be a hacker?

A 6x6 grid is shown. Every cell represents a room of a castle, with open doors on all sides. You have to draw the map of the castle, closing some of the doors.  The number shown  in every room indicates the total number of other rooms visible from that one on straight lines, in all directions: up, down, left and right.  For instance, if you see the number 5 in a cell, it means that a total of 5 cells are visible from there: maybe 2 left and 3 up, or 1 up, 2 down and 2 right, or some other combination giving a total of 5.   Keep in mind that all the rooms can be reached from every other room: there are no  closed rooms, or closed groups of rooms.  To close a door, just tap on it.  If your guess is correct, the door will become a piece of wall, its color will become dark, and you will hear a toc sound.  If your guess is bad, i.e. if the door must be left open, its color will become yellow, you will hear a deng sound, and your choice will be marked as a fault.  When the map is complete, you will hear a musical sound, and an alert message will notify your success, or the total number of faults.","Developer":"Luigi Fonti","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":598016,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/five-field-kono/id408057561","Name":"Five Field Kono","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/43/26/d8/4326d84d-6d09-b9ae-d0d9-3d2356eaebda/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Five Field Kono is a Korean abstract strategy game.

Bridge is a card game played with four people who play as two competing teams of two players called pairs (North-South and East-West). The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.   On Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!  Other players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.  Funbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments). It also suits any player who wants to start playing bridge again (practice, challenges against friends).  Game modes: - Get started with bridge: (re)discover the basics of bridge. - Series tournaments: perfect to see how you compare with players of your level. - Tournaments of the day: compare yourself to players from all around the world. - Practice deals: play deals at your own pace without stress. - Face the elites: pit yourself against top players from the Elite series. - Challenges: challenge any player in head-to-head tournaments. - Two-player game: practise with your favourite partner. - Team Championship: create your team and compete against teams from all over the world. - Federation tournaments: improve your federation ranking thanks to official tournaments held conjointly with bridge federations. - Funbridge Points tournaments: play these tournaments to enter the Funbridge Points rankings and compare yourself to all players. - Exclusive tournaments: create your own tournaments and discuss the deals you play. - Commented tournaments: get valuable advice from a bridge champion.  You can also: - Pause your deal or tournament - Watch a replay of other players\\ moves - Replay deals that you have already played - Get the meaning of the bids made at the table - Seek advice from the AI in case of doubt - Set your bidding and card play conventions - Access an analysis of your play once the deal is over - Meet your friends and chat with them  Internet connection required: the AI is not in the app, which is therefore much more efficient and we can continuously improve it without you having to update it.

It is a mobile game board for use on travel or at home. Searching for lost pieces is a thing of the past. Optionally Halma for iPad can validate the moves on the board. With move validation active the following restrictions are applied to moves:  \\u2022 Only moves or Jumps according to the rules are possible.  \\u2022 After a single field move no further move will be possible. If the move was an error you must use the undo button - that is the button with the blue arrow pointing to the left - to go back.  \\u2022 After a Jump only further Jumps will be possible. A single field move following a Jump will not be accepted.  \\u2022 After moving a piece of a certain color it will not be possible to move another piece of the same color. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on. Thus the other players are able to count how many moves are missing.  For games with three players there is an option for validating the play direction (clockwise or anticlockwise), which can be chosen by an agreement between the players before the game starts. The play direction is determined with the first move of the second player in the game, i.e. the second color in use. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on.  More Options:  \\u2022 End of Move recognition - automatic deselection of a piece if no further move is possible.  \\u2022 remember the game status when the application is suspended and restarted later.  \\u2022 End of Game recognition - bringing the last piece home is reflected by a tiny animation.  \\u2022 Soundeffects on or off  \\u2022 Display of the current time  \\u2022 Color selector for each player  What this App is not:  Halma for iPad is not a Computer Game in common sense. It does not act as an opponent and does not provide any artificial intelligence and therefore cannot be played by a single player.","Developer":"Martin Buergel","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":5775360,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pop-rocks-world-music-rpg-game/id413611238","Name":"POP ROCKS WORLD - MUSIC RPG GAME","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/fd/77/3b/fd773bc6-311e-5990-2a91-491bd53ae0e6/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Download the @FreeAppADay.com Store App and wish for more top rated paid apps like POP ROCKS WORLD - MUSIC RPG GAME  to become FREE for a day!

Labyrinth is the latest addictive puzzle from the legendary game designer, Dr. Reiner Knizia. You take the role of a hero venturing deep into the earth in search of unknown treasures. Along the way you must face both danger and opportunity.   Can you find the way through the labyrinth to the hidden riches deep inside the mountain? Will you be able to defeat the dragons guarding the treasure?   The game mechanics are very simple, but incredibly addictive. You build a labyrinth by dragging tiles into a 4x4 grid and rotating them into place. Your objectives while building the labyrinth are:   1. Get through the labyrinth to the upper side  2. Avoid the monsters  3. Collect swords that let you deal with the monsters  4. Collect treasures on the way   The game is divided into 3 scenarios. You start off in the Hedge Maze, with the basic game as described above. When you have completed all levels of the Hedge Maze, you proceed into the Castle Ruins. This scenario is haunted by ghosts who randomly block tiles and make it harder for you to find your way out. The third scenario is in the Dungeons, and really quite hard to get through.

With this app you can play against a friend on the same iOS device or beat one of the eleven computer opponents.  The goal of Hekkie Hek is to get a Hekkie for each of the values 1 through 12 in as few turns as possible and definitely faster than your opponent. A Hekkie is awarded when you form a number at least five times.  A turn starts with rolling the dice. After that, a number is to be chosen. Choosing a number from 1-6 gives you a point for that number per dice. Choosing a number from 7-12 requires the combination of two dice to sum up to the chosen number. Dice are selected automatically to ensure a maximum score for the chosen number.   The unused dice are rerolled. If your chosen number can be formed from the rerolled dice, this score is added automatically. This continues until you cant form the chosen number again, or when you are awarded a Hekkie. When you get a Hekkie, you get to roll again as if it is a new turn, else its the end of your turn. When you roll three of 7-12 in a turn, all dice are rerolled and you still have the three points from them.

With over 100,000 downloads, Eugene is one of the most popular Chess apps on iTunes. Can you defeat him? Download Eugene now and find out.  HOW SMART IS EUGENE? A good chess player should be able to defeat Eugene with a good game. He starts out with a difficulty of 2, but you can increase it to 3 if he isnt challenging you enough. This will slow Eugene down a bit, especially on devices older than iPhone 4.  Eugene isnt programmed with any pre-set openings. This makes for some interesting and non-traditional situations right from the start. Obviously, this also means that Eugene might get into trouble early since his vision isnt as deep as other engines that play by the book.  Eugenes brains are basically javascript, the language that powers the web. Apple continues to improve the performance of javascript with each new phone so Eugene will continue to get faster.  An actual rating of Eugene is a bit hard to calculate. If someone would like to calculate his actual ELO that would be awesome and I will update this description accordingly. If I had to estimate it I would guess it is maybe 1600.

The difference between this and regular Chess is that the player is allowed to reuse the pieces captured from the opponent for themselves.

Positioning 2 or more Pawns on a vertical line is not permitted if the Pawns are not turned over. Also, although it is possible to put a King in mate with your own Pawn, it is not permitted to put a King in mate with a Pawn captured from your opponent. This is because such act is an insult to the King.   - In the shogi board mode, it is possible to play man face to face. - Three computer levels. - 22 kinds of handicaps. - Position editor. - There is a guide that informs player of a possible movement of the pieces.","Developer":"NUTRACTOR","Age_Rating":"17+","Size":14589952,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balloon-explosion/id420903765","Name":"Balloon Explosion","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/e1/7e/cc/e17ecc93-8463-97ae-a6d2-bac5c0ae91e4/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"If youre having hard time trying to decide whos going to pay that bill, clean that mess after party, or just to choose someone to do something, we can decide it for you.

Players take turns placing their pieces on empty spots. If a player is able to form a row of three pieces along one of the board\\s lines,  he has a mill and may remove one of his opponent\\s pieces from the board; removed pieces may not be placed again.

Moving the pieces:  To move, a player slides one of his pieces along a board line to an empty adjacent spot. If he cannot do so, he has lost the game. As in the placement stage, a player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove one of his opponent\\s pieces, avoiding the removal of  pieces in mills if at all possible.

Word Assist was designed to help you improve your play, yet not do so much, that it takes away the excitement and challenge of the game. Word Assist frees you from the tedium of searching a long list of words, or guessing at random combinations of letters hoping for a valid word, and allows you to focus on the real strategy of the game.  On the Home screen of Word Assist, you can enter your letter tiles, then enter your search string, a maximum length for the word, and click a button to look for the search string at the start of the word, the end of the word, or anywhere in the middle of the word. Example, say your tiles are z,h,o,r,t,e,u and there is a word on your game board back.  You could enter back as the search term, with a max len of 15 and click In Middle, and you would get results such as backhoe worth 19 points or outback worth 18 points.  The results returned are all those words that can be made given the search term (tiles already on the board) and your own letter tiles.  Now, Word Assist does not take into account Double or Triple Word or Letter square values.  This is where the player must employ their own strategy, and is what keeps the game fun to play.  A result that may have a lower word score may be more valuable if a high value tile falls on a Triple Letter square, so, it is up to the player to choose the best word from the list of results.  Why play the game at all if your App plays the game for you?  Here are some other search terms that you could enter and what they mean:  Your Tiles: d,a,e,n,r,i,r  Search term elude with a max length of 15, clicking In Middle returns deluder, deluded, eluded, eluder  You can also use an underscore to be a placeholder for any one of your tiles:  Search term v_i with a max length of 8, clicking In Middle returns vainer, vein etc.  Word Assist also has a Lookup Screen (click the magnifying glass on the Home Screen navigation bar). The Lookup Screen searches the dictionary without any regard for the tiles that you have. So, it is a way for you to verify if a particular word you have in mind is in the dictionary or not. For example, if you were not sure if na was a valid word, you could enter this in the search field on the Lookup Screen, click Search, and if the word is returned as a result, then it was found in the dictionary.  If no results were returned, it does not exist in the dictionary.  You may perform some advanced searches on the Lookup screen using wildcard characters. So, similar to the way we used the underscore (_) character on the Home Screen to be a placeholder for any single character, you could enter f_z in the Search field and click Search and the words fez and fiz will be returned. In effect, your wildcard search requested any three letter word starting with f and ending with z.   You can also use the wildcard character % to represent any number of characters. So, if you entered %z in the Search Field and clicked Search, then you would get results such as razzamatazz (worth 50 points!). Your wildcard search requested words of any length ending with the letter z.   You may also combine wildcard characters. So, if you entered __z% in the Search field, and clicked Search, you would get razzamatazz and zyzzyvas since you requested words of any length, starting with any two letters followed by a z.   Word Assist eliminates the tedium of looking through long word lists for valid words, without taking away the fun and challenge of playing the game!","Developer":"Michael Dougan","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":18002944,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunshine-acres-lite/id425353652","Name":"Sunshine Acres Lite","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple/v4/73/12/a6/7312a68d-0dba-32f5-f0a7-65864987be24/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"IMPORTANT:  This application doesnt support iOS 8.0 or later!

Hanto is must-have board game for your iPad (and its FREE!). It provides you with endless hours of brain teasing fun, either to play by yourself or with a friend face to face! (using your magical device as a magical board)   Develop your strategic skills with the increasingly difficult rule sets and train your ability to think ahead, while you listen to the superb soundtrack by Kevin Mac Leod!  Hanto is a no-brainer download for the smart iPad owner!  ---------------- How to play:  All rule sets are based on a common idea: surround your opponent\\s Butterfly (Queen) before he surrounds yours. Think of a Butterfly like a King in Chess that is captured when it has pieces all around it.  In your turn you can either put a new piece in the board or move one of your existing ones. New pieces can only enter in contact with your own pieces.  You have a limited quantity of pieces, and they all move differently, so you have to think very carefully your move in order to use them wisely and outsmart your opponent!  Finally, but most important of all: all pieces in the game should make one big group at all times, regardless of their owner. This rule can be used at your advantage to block your enemy\\s pieces and prevent them from moving.  Rule sets vary the amount of pieces players have and the way they move.   There are 10 rule-sets to choose from plus the ability to make your own!!!","Developer":"Raul Ignacio Verano","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":40899848,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-books/id428149193","Name":"Go Books","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/28/5d/4b/285d4bbb-3cac-6263-e0bc-e5e0773aa00e/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Enjoy high-quality books about the game of Go on your iPad and iPhone.

Repel an attack by arming the crew, hitting pirates and throwing objects at them. You can move members of the crew across the deck, save them from water and put back on the ship. Make sure that at least one member of the crew is standing on a deck; otherwise pirates will steal the ship.  You can choose from 3 difficulty levels, each of them features 4 ships that are unlocked one by one. Your personal achievements are listed in a table of records.  Use different tactics on different ships. Each member of the crew has their own personality and acts differently (read more on tutorial), so you have to find the most suitable position and weapon for captain, bosun and chef, which differ from level to level. Deck space depends on kind of ship, and on each level there are different types of pirates (read more on tutorial), and each type should be fought using special strategy and the most efficient weapons.

Slide a tile over a bomb to create some more room. But be careful. You may accidentally blow up the tile you need to make your next equation.

And no one remembers how had evil came and chaos reigned. However the equilibrium was lost. But there is still a hidden bond between the columns. And the only those who comprehend it, could restore the frozen equilibrium.     * For those of you, who don\\t like cool epic legends... ;)  The main goal of the game is to bring ice blocks back to zero-level.

You can get them from mom slime playing the game. Max 4 diamonds per stage. You can also get more diamonds playing already cleared stage again.  Q. Why is this game so difficult? Is it possible to clear level 50 without diamonds? A. Frankly speaking, we admit it is difficult. We deliberately design that difficulty level.

It controls everything I want to be on the touchscreen. Great work! - If you are like me, you are always having issues trying to remember what key you need to change something. This app makes it really easy to do some of the things you need most. - Makes it very flexible for us flight simmers rather than using the keyboard in the dark (night flights). Ipad is illuminated and you dont have to keep searching for keys. - Love it for eliminating one of my modified keyboards in my simpit. Since the iPad illuminates the keys no more fumbling. Mount it to your simpit desk and I guarantee youll find it invaluable in no time flat. - This little app introduced new depth into my flight sim experience. Yes, I could have built a home cockpit a long time ago, had I had the required home. But since I move every 3 years this really is no option, yet. SKP-FSX does give my flight buddy and me the opportunity to share tasks when trying to land with zero visibility and sheering wind at 40 knots in northern Canada. It really helps a lot to be able to concentrate on steering and have someone operate the flaps and lower the gear for you, when you try to strafe the plane onto a 15m wide airstrip with an attack angle of 30 degrees. This app makes it possible, and runs like a charm, as does the server program on Windows. - Does most of the functions in FSX you commonly use your keyboard for. I find it so easy now to use all the autopilot settings, ATC, and view commands. Downloaded the server program for the PC and had it installed and running in three minutes. Think I will remap some keys on my flight stick and throttle so I dont think I really need the keyboard at all. Guess Ill use my slide out keyboard tray for my inflight meals and drinks! Thanks for a great program!

The token will continue to move until it hits a blocked square, a visited square, or the edge of the board.  After the token stops, tap on another adjacent square to move again.  Play continues until all squares are visited (you win!) or there are no more moves left (you lose!).  Sometimes you can only move in one direction.

In CrackBlocks you have to crack blocks to make them removable. To crack blocks you have to connect a specific number of blocks with the same color. Therefore, you will get different kind of various colored blocks at the bottom line that you have to lift up. If you have a cracked block group on the map, you can easily remove it by placing another block with the same color beside it. Important is that the block directly touches the cracked group.

This special feature allows you to clear large parts of the map with just one move.

You have a score indicator, a removed blocks tally counter, a level indicator, and a next block preview. Furthermore, in multiplayer games you can see the current rank of each player.

In mine mode your mission is to clear the complete map as fast as possible. The score is counting down, until you have removed all blocks on the map.  The new mission mode sets you tasks to complete predefined maps with predefined blocks.

This version of the game consists of a table, usually with a series of holes called wells or houses, arranged in two rows of equal length. The number of houses in each row are 6, also at the end of the table there are two holes, called barn or bowls. Finally there are the pieces that are usually seeds, but you can use beans, stones, shells or other objects of the same size. I prefer to call them beans:)  Inside of the app: - Single game - Two players - Many options to change the degree of difficulty - Game Center to challenge your friends - Tutorial  Initially, the beans are ready to par and you can choose to start with 3, 4, 5 or 6 beans per home, increasing the number increases the level of difficulty of the game. Each player has the closest row. The game consists of two phases: sowing and capture.  - Sowing The players move alternately. It is to take all the beans are in a certain house and place them in adjacent houses, one for home, when you do not stay up longer in the hands. If the seed does not end in the row where it began, it continues in another row, describing a circular motion counterclockwise. A seed goes to the right in the row nearest the player, and arrived at the end of the row, the row continues attacking from right to left, filling its main bowl (or barn). The seed can be simple, ending with the last piece placed in a house already occupied by any other beans, or relay, which is exactly on finishing his bowl (or barn), this involves another round to earn extra.  - Capture The capture of beans, it happens if we happen after the sowing of beans a house with 0, in this case leads to arrest opponents of the bowl of beans opposite (front).  The aim of the game: The goal is to finish the game with more beans in the bowl the main (or barn). The game will end only when one player has reached the status of famine, it is achieved when there are no more houses in the beans, the beans and remaining opponents are automatically counted and moved into its main bowl.

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible in 16 hands. In competition games the players on one table will rotate so as to have had each of the other three as a partner, so playing 3 sets of 16 hands.  In each hand the object of the game is for the player (and partner) who chooses trumps to collect more than half of the available points. If they fail to do this then they score nothing at all and the opposing pair receives all of the points.

He developed a paper based version of the game over a two year period with the assistance of his son Glenn. George then developed an electronic version of the game on his desktop computer. It was later adapted for iOS devices by Laurie Davis.  CheX is a two person board game that involves strategically placing numbered tokens on a board. Like Sudoku, a number can only appear once in any row or column. Points are collected whenever a token is played, however points are only awarded when a row or column is completed by either player. All points collected by both players in a row or column containing a blocked cell are lost for scoring purposes.  The rules are simple but the strategies can become quite complex.  The basic game is available for free, but there are two additional capabilities available with an in-app purchase. You can purchase the ability to play against an automated opponent. You can also purchase the ability to play against an opponent using Game Center (iOS 5 or later).","Developer":"Laurie Davis","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":9711616,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trenches-2/id470423705","Name":"Trenches 2","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple60/v4/4d/65/89/4d6589ba-20eb-a991-17c9-8bf99a123bcf/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"DIG FOR VICTORY!

This version of the game consists of a table, usually with a series of holes called wells or houses, arranged in two rows of equal length. The number of houses in each row are 6, also at the end of the table there are two holes, called barn or bowls. Finally there are the pieces that are usually seeds, but you can use beans, stones, shells or other objects of the same size. I prefer to call them beans:)  Inside of the app: - Single game - Two players - Many options to change the degree of difficulty - Game Center to challenge your friends - Tutorial  Initially, the beans are ready to par and you can choose to start with 3, 4, 5 or 6 beans per home, increasing the number increases the level of difficulty of the game. Each player has the closest row. The game consists of two phases: sowing and capture. - Sowing The players move alternately. It is to take all the beans are in a certain house and place them in adjacent houses, one for home, when you do not stay up longer in the hands. If the seed does not end in the row where it began, it continues in another row, describing a circular motion counterclockwise. A seed goes to the right in the row nearest the player, and arrived at the end of the row, the row continues attacking from right to left, filling its main bowl (or barn). The seed can be simple, ending with the last piece placed in a house already occupied by any other beans, or relay, which is exactly on finishing his bowl (or barn), this involves another round to earn extra. - Capture The capture of beans, it happens if we happen after the sowing of beans a house with 0, in this case leads to arrest opponents of the bowl of beans opposite (front).  The aim of the game: The goal is to finish the game with more beans in the bowl the main (or barn). The game will end only when one player has reached the status of famine, it is achieved when there are no more houses in the beans, the beans and remaining opponents are automatically counted and moved into its main bowl.

No ads, no in-app purchases, no restrictions.   DIE, PUNY HUMANS \\u2013 Pocket Gamer review of Unstoppable Gorg       Space. The final frontier. Also, the place where you get to blow up evil aliens for the continued glory of your star-spanning imperialist overlords.       There\\u2019s a lot to love about Unstoppable Gorg. The immediate impression is that it\\u2019s a clever parody of 1950s B-movie science fiction, complete with black and white newsreel footage and bargain basement special effects.       That space rocket soaring through the stars? It\\u2019s a toilet roll wrapped in tinfoil and suspended on a piece of string, complete with a sparkler hanging out the back.       This enticement may well be necessary to make you lower your guard and have a go at yet another tower defence game. The genre has been done to death, sure, but take the bait and you\\u2019ll find a new approach that\\u2019s actually pretty darn brilliant.  PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE       So the aliens are attacking. Your job is to fortify key strategic locations in the solar system and repel the invading armies. This being deepest darkest space, however, there\\u2019s a little thing called orbital gravity that you need to take into consideration.       Whatever your position - whether it\\u2019s a planet or a space station or an asteroid - there are concentric rings around it, representing the gravitational field generated by the central mass of the object.       Into these fields of orbit you can slot satellites that will provide either defensive or offensive capabilities. But you can\\u2019t just place these satellites anywhere. There are predetermined slots on each ring - for example, one at 12 o\\u2019clock and another at 4 o\\u2019clock.       When the aliens attack, they do so in waves from multiple directions, and with your satellites fixed in place you can swivel the ring around in a 360-degree circle to meet the threat.       The problem is that when fighting more than one wave at a time your offensive capabilities might be stretched too thin to provide adequate cover.  FORBIDDEN PLANET       Even on the ordinary setting, Unstoppable Gorg is a formidable challenge. After several stages of hand-holding and tutorials, it\\u2019s around about the fifth stage that youll find themselves floundering a little bit.       There are modifiers called research tokens, which allow you to upgrade your satellites, and you might want to go back and replay earlier levels to harvest more of them. That\\u2019s because they can be redeployed at the beginning of every stage - the more tokens you have, the more options you have when formulating a strategy.       Regardless of the difficulty, it\\u2019s worth persevering, if only because this is a fine, fully realised real-time strategy title with excellent production values.       The sci-fi plot has plenty of surprises in store, including new allies to befriend and enemies to fight. If you can make it all the way through to the end you\\u2019re truly one of the greatest armchair generals in the galaxy.       One last thing: Unstoppable Gorg is a port of a desktop computer game (currently available on Steam), but the iPad version lacks none of the features from its bigger counterpart. With the touchscreen interface as opposed to a mouse control scheme, this is probably the best - and best value - of the two.

Your goal: rid the rails of the nasty fly infestation.  The flies refuse to leave the grid.

It seems they dont like each other very much.  And look - each rail in the grid can rotate. When a fly has nowhere to go when prodded, it just sits there, sulking. So if you can rotate the rails such that the flies are able to move, you might be able to knock them into one another. Easy enough, right?  But all the rails in the grid rotate in the same direction, and at the same time. Hmmm. This could get complicated.  The game begins!

Like a relaxing puzzle/strategy game should be, its turn-based, with no time limits between turns. Tiles are dropped into a grid with an oscillating dropper. Touch the screen to arm the dropper, slowing it down and turning on the column lights.  Release your finger to drop the tile into the appropriate column. Theres a heat meter that accrues heat while you hold your finger down.  If it fills up, you are punished with a full row of tiles rained on the grid from above. You keep the heat meter cool by minimizing your finger hold-down time, and making matches. Large matches are rewarded with a free zap token, which, when used, allows you to remove a tile with no heat penalty. To shake things up, theres a fish that randomly pushes tiles up (with some warning).  There are six fun songs to choose from, two of which were graciously contributed by Charlie Hunter, famous recording artist.","Developer":"Sincereal","Age_Rating":"4+","Size":185323520,"Original_Release_Date":"2008-7-11","Current_Version_Release_Date":"2017-5-30"},{"Url_Game":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/american-trainworks/id480887001","Name":"American Trainworks","Subtitle":"Not Subtitle","Icon_Url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/13/11/1a/13111a08-db1c-3530-d362-b16e589cf15a/source/512x512bb.jpg","Description":"Full steam ahead with this realistic steam engine simulation, American Trainworks.

The pieces and their moves will be familiar to anyone that has played standard chess, which makes this an ideal game for players of all skill levels. Certain spaces on the board allow pieces to make special moves, some of which are simply mind-blowing. Special visual effects and sounds enhance play. You can play locally with friends or challenge yourself against 3 levels of artificial intelligence. You can play alone or in teams of 2 vs. 2.   If you like chess or chess variants, you can hardly afford to miss out on Warlord Chess.   But I don\\u2019t know 4 good chess players... Don\\u2019t worry! Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.   Most importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!   That is a crazy looking board... That\\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.   The Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \\u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!   The Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard.
