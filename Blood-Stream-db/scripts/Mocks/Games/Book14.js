The Allies must marshal their resources to gain and secure control of as many beaches as they can by days end: a run-through of the 110-card deck.  However, the Axis has the starting advantage; the Allies need to avoid being caught dead in the water. Although most units are preassigned to a beach, each game is won or lost by the placement of cards that provide additional forces or support. Not only is the state of each beach important to consider for these decisions, but also the geography of the coastline - after a beach has been won, the victorious forces can flank adjacent beaches. Both players must always be thinking ahead, looking for ways to best utilise their cards down the line.

Why there are different kinds of tax? How tax influence the life of individuals?   I do not have answers, so I made a game, as an experiment, try to simulate it. In this game, I put a few farmers in the middle of nowhere. They will cultivate and farm their lands, start their family, and build wealth. When they are rich, they will take breaks, rent their lands to others, or buy goods to improve their lives. They would even choose becoming a craftsman if there are strong demands in their neighborhood. When life gets more difficult, they will move to a new area for better opportunities. If they lost everything and become hopeless, they will become rebels, robbing money from your government.  You, the player, is the leader of your people. You can decide how to collect tax, recruit guards and workers, and build different large infrastructures.  At any time, you can pause your game and view the life of any person. You can see how your tax policies and decisions affect their lives. Here are some examples: Tom was a farmer who had a little land and saving. After you ordered him working on infrastructures for several years, he might run out of saving, had to sell his farm and work on others farms. Joe was a young adult who just got independent. His father did not give him any farm. Joe could not find a job or a land to cultivate. But because your tax is low, everyone around him had some extra money to spend. Joe might decide to spend a few years learning craftsmanship as an apprentice. After he graduated, Joe served his community with his skills and lived a wealthy life. Jimmy bought and cultivated a lot of farms when you had a low farm tax. When you increased the farm tax later, he could not afford the tax and chose to sell them at a much lower price to his neighbors.     To me, this game is interesting because every number you change (or not change) has impacts on someones life, opens some new options, or closes some doors.   The game will be over if all your people died, your goverment run out of money, or the leader died without an heir. You have to start a new game when the game is over. You can try carefully adjusting your tax, keep everything in balance, and build a kingdom that last thousands of years. Or you can be creative with your policies, do all kinds of experiments on this simulated land. The decision is yours.  I wish you have a fun time playing this game.', Developer: 'Yifei Zhao', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 50944000, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zombie-fidget-spinner/id1260281824', Name: 'Zombie Fidget Spinner', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/5d/c2/e2/5dc2e227-2c1b-df2f-9998-bc4cc995a48d/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Zombie Fidget Spinner is a fun and addicting game guaranteed to keep you busy for hours!

More numbers are better. Please, decide a person who will play a moderator role. All the rest players sit in a circle. The moderator decides a number of players and roles on the werewolf application. There should be at least two \\u201cWerewolf\\u201d players and one \\u201cSeer\\u201d All the rest \\u201cVillager\\u201d. Push the start button and give the app to the first player. The player should put his name and check his role, but must keep it secret. The next player does the same way as previous player. If they have done it all and then give the app back to the moderator. Two players are now secretly werewolves. They are trying to slaughter everyone in the village. * The number of werewolves can be grown as the number of players   - The Game: Night and Day  The game proceeds in alternating night and day phases. We begin with Night. At Night, the moderator tells all the players Close your eyes. Everyone should. The moderator says Werewolves, open your eyes. The two werewolves do so, and look around to recognize each other. The moderator says Werewolves, pick someone to kill. The two werewolves silently agree on one villager to kill. (It is critical that they remain silent. The other players are sitting there with their eyes closed, and the werewolves don\\t want to give themselves away. Sign language is appropriate, or just pointing, nodding, raising eyebrows, and so on.) When the werewolves have agreed on a victim, and the moderator understands who they picked, the moderator says Werewolves, close your eyes. The moderator says Seer, open your eyes. Seer, pick someone to ask about. The seer opens his eyes and silently points at another player. (Again, it is critical that this be entirely silent -- because the seer doesn\\t want to reveal his identity to the werewolves.) The moderator silently signs thumbs-up if the seer pointed at a werewolf, and thumbs-down if the seer pointed at an innocent villager. The moderator then says Seer, close your eyes. The moderator says Everybody open your eyes; it\\s daytime. And you have been torn apart by werewolves. He indicates the person that the werewolves chose. That person is immediately dead and out of the game. He reveals his card, showing what he was, and leaves it face-up. Now it is Day. Daytime is very simple; all the living players gather in the village and lynch somebody. The mob wants bloody justice. As soon as a majority of players vote for a particular player to die, the moderator says Ok, you dead. That player then reveals his card, and the rest of the players find out whether they\\ve lynched a human, a werewolf, or the seer. There are no restrictions on speech. Any living player can say anything he wants -- truth, misdirection, nonsense, or lie. Contrariwise, dead players may not speak at all. As soon as the sun comes up and the moderator indicates that someone is dead, he may not speak for the rest of the game. No dying soliloquies allowed. Similarly, as soon as a majority vote indicates that a player has been lynched, he is dead. If he wants to protest his innocence or reveal some information (like the seer\\s visions), he has to do it before the vote goes through. No player may reveal his card, to anyone, even when he is killed. All you can do is talk. Once a player is lynched, night falls immediately and the cycle repeats. Everyone closes their eyes, the werewolves (or werewolf) secretly select someone to kill, the seer (if alive) secretly learns another player\\s status; then the sun rises, one player is found dead, and the remaining players begin to discuss another lynching. Repeat until one side wins.   - Winning  The humans win if they kill both werewolves. The werewolves win if they kill enough villagers so that the numbers are even. (Two werewolves and two humans, or one werewolf and one human.) At that point they can rise up and slaughter the villagers openly.  * Please, go to our website for more detail.', Developer: 'joong seok lee', Age_Rating: '9+', Size: 191240192, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kiwi-evolution-idle-tycoon-clicker-game/id1262359590', Name: 'Kiwi Evolution - Idle Tycoon & Clicker Game', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/99/ae/03/99ae032f-222d-eee0-2659-89d0c3f54049/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Find out what happens to an kiwi food evolution when the evolution started, combine two kiwi to evolve and discover the most curious and funny forms of your favorite food.

GAME RULES Match the patterns in each level and complete as many necklaces as possible. To pass a level, you need to fulfil the goal of the level before youre out of moves.  GOALS The levels can have three different types of goals:          *  SCORE A score goal requires that you gather a given number of points before the game ends.  You earn points for each pattern you complete. The number of points increases with the number of completed patterns in the necklace. The first completed pattern in a necklace will result in 1 point, the second in 2 points, the third in 3 points, etc. You will also get extra points for each completed necklace - the points will match the number of completed patterns in the necklace.  *  PATTERNS A pattern goal requires that you complete a given number of patterns before the game ends.  The number of gems included in a pattern vary from level to level. The gems describing the pattern are marked with a surrounding white glow. When you add a gem that breaks the pattern in a necklace, the necklace will be destroyed and a new pattern will be created for you.  *  NECKLACES A necklace goal requires that you complete a given number of necklaces before the game ends.  A necklace is complete when all gem holders in it are filled with gems that follow the initial pattern. When a necklace is completed a new pattern is created and you can continue to build the new necklace.  GIFTS From time to time a necklace that you are working on will be marked with a star:  If you manage to complete a necklace marked with star without breaking the pattern, you will receive a gift - something to help you pass the levels.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat (check) to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.  During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player (White) has pieces of a light color; the other player (Black) has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponents pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.  Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries.   -- 12 play levels (Novice->Expert) This uses intelligent weakening for lower levels.

The game is also known as Nine Man Morris, Mill, Mills, The Mill Game, Merels, Merrills, Merelles, Marelles, Morelles and Nine penny Marl in English. Nine Men\\s Morris is a solved game in which either player can force the game into a draw.  Rules: The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces, or men, usually colored black and white.  Players try to form \\mills\\\\u2014three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\\u2014allowing a player to remove an opponent\\s man from the game.  A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where he could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving him without a legal move.  Phase 1: Placing pieces The game begins with an empty board. The players determine who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play on empty points.  If a player is able to place three of his pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, he has formed a mill and may remove one of his opponent\\s pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that a piece in an opponent\\s mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.  Phase 2: Moving pieces Players continue to alternate moves, this time moving a man to an adjacent point. A piece may not jump another piece.  Players continue to try to form mills and remove their opponent\\s pieces as in phase one. A player can break a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent\\s men.  The act of removing an opponent\\s man is sometimes called pounding the opponent. When one player has been reduced to three men, phase three begins.  Phase 3: Flying When a player is reduced to three pieces, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points: The player\\s men may fly from any point to any vacant point. Some rules sources say this is the way the game is played, some treat it as a variation, and some don\\t mention it at all. A 19th-century games manual calls this the truly rustic mode of playing the game.  Flying was introduced to compensate when the weaker side is one man away from losing the game.  Essential Skills for the 9 men morris game Problem Solving - analyze puzzle configurations Logical Thinking - match wits against your computer opponent Planning Strategies - assess each challenge and determine your next move Winning Nine Men\\s Morris The first player to get his opponent down to two pieces, or to block his opponent from making any legal moves, is the winner.

Please sink the enemy battleship using the main gun during the battle time.   2: Two VR-Battle mode  There are two VR-Battle Modes; \\u201cTEST BATTLE\\u201d and \\u201cPRO BATTLE\\u201d.  The function of VR is expected to differ depending on the situation of your device, VR adapter, etc. Therefore, we recommend you to try battleship operation and main gun operation in VR test battle mode which you can enjoy for free first. In other words, it is to be familiar with a series of tasks such as quickly finding an enemy battleship, issuing a VR menu, matching main gun sights and shooting.  \\u2460 VR TEST BATTLE MODE:  You can fight without a BATTLE COIN. Battle conditions are as follows.    \\xb7 Number of shells: 12 shells   \\xb7 Simultaneous shooting number:          3 simultaneous firing (maximum of one turret x 3)   \\xb7 Battle time: 180 seconds   \\u2461 VR PRO BATTLE MODE:  1 BATTLE COIN is required per 1 \\u201cVR PRO BATTLE. Battle conditions are as follows.    \\xb7 Number of shells: 150 shells   \\xb7 Simultaneous shooting number:  \\u201cALL-SALVO\\u201d !!         9 simultaneous launches (maximum 3 guns each 3 turret)   \\xb7 Battle time: 600 seconds  BATTLE COIN can be purchased as in-app items.   3: VR Battle Operation  Please refer to the description of the operation explanation.  Usually the VR battleship operation menu is not displayed. VR Battleship Operation Menu appears by tilting the head sideways.  The function begins to move by matching the VR cursor at the center of the line of sight to the spherical operation switch on the menu. You can check whether the operation has been performed by changing the color of the operation switch or sound.  In the VR test battle, we recommend that you train battleship navigation and gun control and launch.  When stopping the operation switch, it takes a while for the operation to actually stop after turning it off. In the case of a main gun sight towards an enemy battleship, it is necessary to understand this characteristic well before turning it off a little earlier. With this in mind, we recommend that you practice main gun sighting quickly and practice to hit enemy battleship with main gun\\u2019s shells.   The VR battleship operation menu is basically the same as the free iOS application \\u201cBATTLE OF BATTLESHIP. Tutorial on battleship operation is also prepared for this application, so please refer as necessary.   4: Simulation Summary  Simulation is realized basically under the same condition as the free application Battleship fighting space. The outline is shown below.    [1] The Physical Law Modification:   To realize the short-time and amazing spectacle battle of huge battleships, some of the physical   laws in this Real-Time Simulation World are carefully modified.

Read on \\u2026.  FOR THE BRIDGE MASTER  Becoming frustrated with partner, and their bidding, is a fundamental aspect of playing Bridge (some actually seem to enjoy this!)  This frustration is multiplied tenfold in computer Bridge, when \\u2018partner\\u2019 is an inanimate AI Robot, who will not take any notice of your frowns and shouts, and with whom you cannot discuss matters over a drink. WiZBridge+ eliminates all this frustration, by \\u2026eliminating \\u2018partner\\u2019!  Loosely based on the established teaching game Mini Bridge,(with many improvements and innovations) ALL BIDDING IS DEFUNCT! Each player (starting with dealer) announces their HCP count, and the player with the highest count, from the partnership with the highest total, becomes the declarer. At this point, his partner becomes \\u2018dummy\\u2019 and tables his hand for all to see. Declarer now decides on the Trump suit, and the number of tricks that he\\u2019ll make. As this is a computer game, you\\u2019ll be making the decision and playing the cards whenever your side becomes declarers.  Does that sound easy \\u2026 It\\u2019s not! Because while you\\u2019re deciding on trumps, and playing the cards, Robot is doing exactly the same thing behind the scenes. The aim of the game is to beat Robot in a \\u2018head-to-head\\u2019 game of Duplicate. Robot is an internationally acclaimed AI, so you\\u2019ve got to be on your toes to get one over on him. Try it \\u2026 you\\u2019ll be amazed how challenging and rewarding it is. Then there\\u2019s also the added \\u2018spice\\u2019 of playing Duplicate against other users (read all about it below)  FOR THE BEGINNER AND INTERMEDIATE PLAYER  You\\u2019re learning this game, and it\\u2019s soooooo frustrating, especially the bidding. Wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to ditch this frustration and concentrate on the fun part \\u2013 the actual card play. With WiZBridge+, you can have hours of fun simply playing contracts, while at the same time learning from Robot the best line of  play, and indeed in deciding what the contract should be. An invaluable tool for anyone who\\u2019s on the long and sometimes arduous road of improving, or merely starting to learn Bridge.   FOR THE ABSOLUTE NOVICE  Undoubtedly the most complex and daunting aspect of learning Bridge is the bidding. WiZBridge+ bypasses the bidding, and enables complete novices to practice, enjoy, and improve on their card play and hand analysis., within minutes of downloading the app.  And to help you learn, The app is packed with documents, Help files and Info buttons to guide and teach you along the way. You\\u2019ll soon be progressing through the 4 levels, each level introduces more Bridge related complexity and strategy.  DUPLICATE  While It\\u2019s great beating a Robot, it\\u2019s a different level of thrill entirely when you beat your peers. WiZBridge+ has 24/7 Duplicate competitions, where you\\u2019ll be competing with other players who\\u2019ve been given exactly the same hands, and who\\u2019ll also be trying to beat Robot on their own devices. Duplicate is available at the top two levels of WiZBridge+. Although there are no prizes, the real and meaningful prize is to watch your Statistics and averages improve over time.  STATISTICS & RANKS  We Bridge players love our statistics, and in WiZBridge+ they\\u2019re in abundance. There are statistics at every level, where you can monitor your progress. In Duplicate there is also a Ranking system, so you can see the relative \\u2018quality\\u2019 of opponents in your competition.

Onitama is somewhat reminiscent of chess and rather addictive with its dynamic game mechanic in which warriors face off so their master may win the game. Concentration and luck are the only weapons youll have at your disposal! Youll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.  THINK STRATEGY!  Every opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponents elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but youll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as youll have to think ahead about moves! The moves youre allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.  ITS ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS\\u2026  The key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom. In short, its an elegant and simple game that captures the essence of martial arts. The game design and calligraphy will make your gaming experience a unique and unforgettable one.   PLAY ON YOUR OWN OR WITH OTHERS Play against the computer on your own, or against your friends.

The aim is to match the upper board layout by moving the tiles of the bottom board around. When tiles overlap each other their colors blend.  Each new level presents new challenges and you can try to unlock all color themes by completing levels. You can also compare your progress with your friends on Game Center.  The game is most suitable from 10 years old and up. However younger children may also benefit.  How to play?  * Drag shapes in the bottom board and try to create the same layout as the upper board.  * When two shapes overlap their colors blend, for example a white tile overlapping a black tile produces a gray tile.   * When two shapes overlap and you would like to move the shape beneath, you can tap on the tile multiple times, revealing the shapes beneath.  * The shades of gray differ according to the amount of white or black tiles, for example a tile consisting of two black tiles and one white tile will be a darker shade of gray.

Score bonuses and multi-bonuses for completing horizontal, vertical or diagonal rows. Complete the board within 8 turns and score a completion bonus & carry your score & unused rolls over to a new board (if playing Continuous mode).  The objective of Dice Match Bingo is to complete rows of random dice by matching them with the dice rolled at the top of the screen. The ultimate aim is to match every die on the game screen and score a completion bonus. You have 8 turns per game to try and match as many dice as possible. Every die you match scores points at the face value of that die.  Rows can be completed vertically, horizontally and diagonally from corner to corner. Every time a row is completed you will score bonus points - 100 for a horizontal row, 150 for a vertical row and 200 for a diagonal row. When you complete more than 1 row simultaneously, you score a 200 point bonus for each row completed in that turn. If you complete the entire grid, you will score a 1000 point bonus plus an additional 1000 points for every roll remaining in the game.  You earn a Bonus Die for every 10 games you play. Bonus Dice can be used to complete a board when you have 1 unmatched die left after your last roll.  GAMEPLAY The screen has 6 dice along the top and a grid of 36 dice that are randomly allocated values at the start of the game. Begin by tapping on the Start button to take your first roll of the dice along the top. If the Show Match Hints option in Settings is turned on, any dice on the grid that match any number rolled at the top will be highlighted and can be selected. As you select matches in the grid, your selection and the corresponding rolled die will turn blue. A blue rolled die cannot be used again in the current turn - however you can make it available again by tapping on a selected (blue) match in the grid to deselect it. You can also move a selected match by tapping on any other matched die with the same value. Once you have selected 6 matches in the grid (or less if you rolled a number that doesnt have a corresponding match), tap the Roll button to take your next turn. The dice you selected will change to red to show they are now locked and not available to be selected again. If you completed a row, all the dice in that row will change to green to indicate that the row is complete. In Standard mode, the game ends after 8 turns or if you complete the grid in less than 8 turns.  CONTINUOUS MODE In Continuous mode, if you complete the board your score & any unused rolls are carried over to a new board & the game continues.  TIMED MODE Timed mode adds the challenge of only being allowed 6 seconds per turn. Once your time is up, the game automatically rolls the dice for the next turn.  SCORING Matched Die - face value Horizontal Row - 100 Vertical Row - 150 Diagonal Row - 200 Multiple Rows - 200 times the number of rows All Dice Matched - 1000 + 1000 times the number of rolls left in the game  DICE COLORS Yellow - die matches one (or more) of the dice rolled & can be selected.

Ich bin Grips. Ich stelle dir reichhaltige mathematische Aufgaben nach Lehrplan 21. Das sind Aufgaben bei denen du schulisches Grundwissen brauchst, aber auch etwas studieren musst. Du brauchst etwas Grips oder K\\xf6pfchen! Aber keine Angst ausser im Testmodus helfe ich dir immer. Der Mehrwert besteht darin, dass ich immer an deiner Seite stehe. Mit deinem Schulwissen der Oberstufe (3. Zyklus) und deinen guten Ideen sind meine Aufgaben die ich dir stelle gut l\\xf6sbar. Du l\\xf6st zuerst mein Entdeckungsmodus. Wenn dir die z\\xfcndende Idee wirklich nicht kommt, dr\\xfcckst du einfach die Spicktaste und schon blende ich dir z.B. eine entscheidende Hilfslinie ein, die dir hilft die L\\xf6sung zu finden. Wenn du es dann doch noch verplant hast, gibt dir meine Wiederholungstaste einmal eine zweite Chance. Ich erkl\\xe4re dir auch viele Aufgabe in einem anschaulichen Videoclip ganz genau. Der Lehrplan 21 legt Wert auf reichhaltige Aufgaben mit mehreren m\\xf6glichen L\\xf6sungswegen. Reichhaltige Aufgaben sind anregend, herausfordernd, kognitiv aktivierend, interessant, mehrschichtig. Bei mehreren Aufgaben zeigst du nicht nur die richtige L\\xf6sung, sondern zeigst verschiedene L\\xf6sungswege oder m\\xf6gliche Skizzen. Deine Antworten korrigiere ich dann auch sofort. Ich schreibe hinein, was genau du falsch gemacht hast oder gebe dir genaue Kommentare und zeige dir anschaulich dargestellt die L\\xf6sungswege, damit du aus deinen eigenen Fehlern lernst. Das musst du, damit du dann den Testmodus selbst\\xe4ndig l\\xf6sen kannst.

Es gibt keine Erkl\\xe4rvideoclips. Einzig die Zeit stoppe ich dir bei jeder Aufgabe. Ich stelle dir fast die gleichen Aufgaben wie im Entdeckungsmodus.

Diesen empfehle ich zuerst den Testmodus zu l\\xf6sen und mit dem Entdeckungsmodus nachher die Fehler zu verbessern.  Ich kann dir auch Hinweise f\\xfcr deine Eignung zu einem technischen Beruf geben.

Texas Holdem Poker Enthusiasts: a virtual tracking assistant to help evaluate your game situations (online or in person) precisely and quickly, thus making more informed betting decisions while improving game-play skills on-the-fly. Texas Holdem Poker Novices: teach players the intricacies of the Texas Holdem decision-making process without the need for playing a tremendous number of games and learning terminology, game-flow, game-insights and all the associated decision-making consequences on-the-fly.  Why is Texas Holdem Edge unique? The App does not require opponents for you to play against, as most apps require. This allows a user to explore how your decision to stay in or fold in a game impacts whether you win or lose. This new approach also allows a player to stop and think and evaluate their situation more clearly and not under pressure. A player can now deep dive an immersive game to understand all aspects of game situations (changing dealt and community hands, number of players), and to go forward and backward in time to learn more.

The \\u201cTexas Holdem Edge\\u201d program is devised to:  (1) Educate you on the intricacies of the game (2) Expand your understanding of the progression a player should take in making better betting decisions. What it does not... \\u201cTexas Holdem Edge\\u201d is not concerned with the individual chips placed in the pot. This is to simplify the game and provide a broader, more complete game theory perspective,  It is more focused on:  (1) The overall process of staying in or getting out of a hand at the proper points in a game (2) Using your leverage properly to maximize wins and minimize losses.  Poker enthusiasts know that one can conscientiously track another players betting decisions over time and understand the leverage their holdings and pot commitments have on others at the table. However, \\u201cTexas Holdem Edge\\u201d will give you a better and more complete understanding of hand rank, card texture, player table position, and current betting round with number of opponents implications. When this knowledge is learned, and ingrained, you will join the best players who grind out games and better counter the behavior of other players.

And if you manage it, can you do it quicker and in less moves then anyone else?  Matching numbers sums them into one and helps clear the board.  Once you get three matching numbers in a row you can swipe them, score larger points and generate a powerup to help you manage the board more efficiently.  Powerups perform special actions on tiles such as: - Swap Any Two - Match Any Two - Double/Halve A Number and more.  Using these powerups effectively will enable you to generate larger numbers and score larger points.  Powerups are also generated by matching higher numbers.  If you swipe enough times you also generate additional Swipe Bonuses, which give extra bonuses to aid you.  Twos also supports Leaderboards and Achievements, which further enhance the challenge.

When youre in game,  youll notice at first 1 large square with white borders - this is your holding square - NEVER, EVER touch the borders!  Another random colored square will appear, now this is your target area.    And then, a few short seconds after, a random colored square will increase in size growing towards the edge of the target area.   Ideally you want to tap the screen when the growing square touches the edge of the target so that the difference in size between the growing square and target is exactly 0px.   Now this is tough,  very tough, especially when the growing square eventually picks up the pace.    Youll notice on the right hand side theres a green icon - this specifies whats the minimum distance/size +/- you can stop the growing square from the target.   If the difference in size is greater than that the icon specifies then youre going to have a bad time.   If you get the distance 1.5px or less your score will decrease - remember the aim of the game is to get very low pxs.

Initially, the hospital has an Emergency Care floor (EC), which will assign each patient to the correct doctor. All patients enter the hospital and walk to the EC receptionist in order to request an appointment with one of the specialties. Each patient has one of three possible diseases: pixel, glitch and monoChrome. Each disease has its own probability of occurrence and a specific floor to perform the treatment. If you do not have the floor needed to attend a patient at the time the patient will request this service to the EC receptionist and you will be penalized in cash for not attending the patient. Otherwise, the patient is referred to the floor with the smaller queue. The rarer the disease, the greater the value received by the treatment.

The purpose of Solitaire generally involves manipulating a layout of cards with a goal of sorting them in some manner  Solitaire Rules 1. The different piles: There are four different types of piles in Solitaire. They are: - The Stock: The pile of facedown cards in the upper left corner. - The Waste: The faceup pile next to the Stock in the upper left corner. - The Foundations: The four piles in the upper right corner. - The Tableau: The seven piles that make up the main table. 2. The setup: The Tableau piles are numbered from 1 to 7, pile 1 has 1 card, pile 2 has 2 cards and so on. The top card on each Tableau pile is turned face up, the cards below are turned face down. The cards that are left after setting up the Tableau are placed in the Stock, face down. The Waste and the Foundations start off empty. 3. The objective: To win Solitaire, you must get all the cards onto the Foundation piles. The Foundations are ordered by suit and rank, each Foundation has one suit and you must put the cards onto them in the order Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King. To get there, you can use the moves described below. 4. Allowed moves - Flip cards from the Stock onto the Waste. You can flip either 3 cards from the Stock onto the Waste. - Move a card from the Waste onto the Foundations. If the top card of the Waste can go onto one of the Foundations then you can drag it there. - Move a card from the Waste onto the Tableau. You can move the top card of the Waste onto one of the Tableau piles. - Move a card from a Foundation back onto the Tableau. You can move the top card of a Foundation back onto the Tableau. This isnt allowed in all Solitaire versions, but we allow it here :) - Move one or more cards from one Tableau pile to another. You can move a face up card on the Tableau onto another Tableau pile, if that piles top card is one higher than the moved card and in a different color. For example, you could move a red 6 onto a black 7. Or, if you have red 6, black 5, red 4 face up on one tableau, you can move all of them at the same time onto a Tableau with a black 7. If you have an empty Tableau pile then you can only place a king there. - You can flip a face down Tableau card. If you have moved a face up card from a Tableau pile so now the top card is face down, then you can click the face down card and it will be flipped and shown face up. - You can move a Tableau card onto the Foundations. You can do this manually if you need to clear some space on the Tableau. You can either drag the cards onto the Foundation, or just double touch it and then it will go there by itself. When all cards on the Tableau are turned up, and all cards from the stock are finished then the game will automatically move all the Tableau cards onto the Foundations, since at that point you are guaranteed to win the game. - You can Undo as many times as you like. The game offers unlimited undos. Each Undo counts as a new move though, so if youre trying to win the game in as few moves as possible you should be careful about how many undos you use.', Developer: 'Mai Ha Ngoc Nhu', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 21614592, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gunship-battle-air-strike-2018/id1317209479', Name: 'Gunship Battle Air Strike 2018', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/21/e1/68/21e16872-665c-e9f0-8f6b-171d2a9c4d29/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Welcome to the helicopter shooting games or helicopter gunships games and get ready for the helicopter fight in helicopter fighting games.

You must amass an army of Green Things to defend the other green thing.   At any given time your army can consist of 30 troops. Troops can spawn once some energy is built up on the green thing. Wait longer and the troops are stronger or get impatient and send a full army of weaklings out , do what you want its your army.   Melee troops are round green troops with blue pointy things that stick out, if the blue pointy thing hits a red thing it hurts them, and you (physically and emotionally).   Gunners shoot their little hearts out and chase the red things until they get in range, then they plant their feet and fire away (actually its never been proven that they have feet but it is assumed).   Snipers sit back and shoot their little hearts out. every shot they loose health (hey its a big gun). but they can also stab the red things with their own blue pointy thing once again hand to hand combat causes some damage to the sniper (I don\\t thing they have hands that would be silly)  Rushers are dumb, they walk in a straight line and are great offensive troops (too bad its a defensive game). but they can get you some points or cause a distraction as they march forward to their certain death.   Then there is the laser, it is bright blue and it hurts the red things feelings (and their heads). you have to collect the gems to fire it off...
