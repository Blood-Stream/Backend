A curfew will be in force starting at dusk.\\u201d  Background: In the late eighties, the US Army researched a substance to optimize the fighting ability of their soldiers. Z1988-N1 (a modified flu virus) was designed to block pain receptors and help soldiers remain battle-ready despite any wounds they might incur.  In addition to blocking pain receptors, one ranger squad experimentally infected with Z1988-N1 remained battle-ready despite the experiment subjects suffering life-threatening injuries. However, injured tissue could not regenerate. The soldiers also became extremely aggressive and lost any and all sense of empathy. After a short while they needed to be isolated as it was impossible to guarantee the safety of those in their surroundings. The test subjects fell physically and mentally into a zombie state, where they would try to eat the uninfected.  Ten days after the start of the experiment the brass attempted to stop it. All infected people were liquidated with a shot to the head and the virus samples were sealed off. However, something went really wrong two months ago\\u2026  Your task: The virus has spread faster than the government feared. After Z1988-N1 has taken over the east coast, the epidemic spread over the entire planet.

And as you do, the game evolves with you, providing a worthy challenge every time. Militia also features procedurally generated levels so the challenge stays fresh.   In Militia, you are the leader of a small troop of warriors, mages and cavalry and attempt to rout the local marauding banditry by dispatching their captains. Gameplay is turn based; on your turn you can issue one command to each of your units, and then the enemies each move on their turn according to strict and transparent movement rules.   NOTE: Includes Dark World expansion content for free (The Dark World is a separate and advanced game mode with its own heroes, enemies and ladder).

Recollect is a working memory training game produced by the University of California Riverside (UCR) Brain Game Center for Mental Fitness and Well-being; A research unit focused on brain fitness methods and applications. Recollect is our third installment of memory training games, and is highly premised upon empirical data derived from its predecessors. Recollect maintains the effective framework of previous installments, but takes a leap forward by incorporating additional cognitive challenges and features intended to generalize the effectiveness of the program into a side-scrolling platformer.  Recollect has been designed for all age groups interested in fun and effective brain-training. Based on over a decade of cognitive and neuroscience research, Recollect incorporates scientifically supported renditions of N-Back, Item Span, and Multiple-Identity tracking tasks. These tasks are independently shown to improve working memory in a manner that transfers to untrained tasks.   Recollect is the product of a multi-faceted research project to answer questions related to working memory improvement, brain plasticity, and issues surrounding attention and reinforcement within cognitive training programs. Players are immersed into a game environment where they must perform and improve upon different cognitive tasks in order to advance to new realms and unlock advanced features. Our cognitive tasks are coupled together in a reward based framework that reinforces user adherence to the program and maintain training efficacy.   The premise of the game is set in a multi-world universe where the player is an astronaut (Lerner) tasked with collecting resources for the last human space colony. The player must explore planets in order to gather the necessary plants and minerals needed to feed the colony and keep their technology working. Players will experience that the required resources and planets are tricky, as resources must be collected in specific sequences to prevent them from quickly deteriorating, and planets are riddled with hazardous materials and obstacles. The mission is to help Lerner navigate the perilous terrain by using her memory skills to safely gather the resources.

You knew the day would come, and you have been getting ready for this moment. Remember what you have learnt about surviving a zombie disaster and guide your people in this post-apocalyptic adventure.  The world as we know it no longer exists; now it is time to create a new one. It won\\u2019t be easy! The zombies are a true plague. They\\u2019re not very smart, but they\\u2019re everywhere, and they are legion.  Build your own shelter and make it safe. Find survivors and convince them to join you. Together you will be able to improve the shelter and create a new home. Those will be the first steps towards building a new civilization, a new zombie-free world for humans.  But the road to survival is filled with danger. There are no governments, no authorities: anarchy reigns over the world. Survival not only depends on staying away from the zombies, you must also defend your shelter from bandits and thieves. Other survivors have built shelters too, and they see you as a threat. In this post-apocalyptic world, every new settlement that is discovered is considered a threat and treated like a dangerous enemy. Trust is no longer the order of the day \\u2013 it is an exception.  DEFEAT THE PLAGUE Lead your squad against the zombie hordes and defeat the undead. Attack their gathering points and collect resources to help your people. Victory in the war against the undead lies in your hands.   FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL Attack other settlements to survive. Study their defenses, prepare your team, and develop the right strategy to get inside other shelters to steal their resources.  DEFEND WHAT IS YOURS Train your team to defend your base and configure a defensive system to protect it from the zombies. But do not underestimate survivors! Humans from other settlements will try to plunder your shelter.  RECRUIT SURVIVORS Find isolated people, and together build a safe place to live, far from zombies and bandits.

The aircraft carrier task force was a quite new war potential. Although its offensive power was extremely high, the defensive ability was poor.   Since no one knew how to utilize this war potential at that time, there might be  various possibilities in the short term.  As a commander of the air craft carrier task force, make strategic decisions and lead your task force to the victory.  In this game, you will play the following important roles in the every layer.   1) Commander of aircraft carrier task force  - Make a Decision  2) Captain of aircraft carrier  \\u2013 Maneuver your aircraft carrier   3) Pilot of Search Plane \\u2013 Search Enemy\\u2019s aircraft task force  4) Leader of Torpedo Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by torpedoes  5) Leader of Bomber Attack Group  - Attack enemy aircraft by dive bombs  6) Leader of Intercept Fighter Group \\u2013 Intercept enemy attack group  1.

It has all the standard chess pieces you would expect: King, Queen, Knight Bishop, Rook, and Pawn; plus a new piece called the Duke. The rules adhere to a purist interpretation of traditional Chess rules, but on a hexagonal board of 96 triangles instead of 64 squares; with the pieces moving on six axes instead of four. The Duke is similar to a Bishop or a Rook in that it is able to move in straight lines across the board. The Knight can move to any of 12 spaces. The Queen moves like a combination of the Duke, the Bishop, and the Rook. The King can move one space in any of 12 directions. The number of pawns has been increased to create an appropriate wall of pawns protecting each side.   With possible moves highlighted at each turn, it is easy to learn the game. There is also a help tutorial within the game to describe and demonstrate the way each piece moves and captures.   The game includes multiple modes of play, including: - Single Player vs the Computer - Local Two-Player - Online Two-Player  Online players are ranked according to the Glicko rating system.', Developer: 'SiliconLoom, LLC', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 92601344, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/defence-monster/id1229341465', Name: 'Defence Monster', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple91/v4/11/d9/80/11d98078-22de-1827-d081-884dd6ffeea2/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'Defence Monster is type of strategy defense games.

While serving as a continuation of the Galactic Phantasy Universe, Over Space has been completely designed from scratch and features a whole new story and multiplayer gameplay system.   # # # Form an alliance, Rule Over Space  The Alliance Wars are on!  Space battles are no longer just about space. Explore every one of the planets in the Over Space Universe thoroughly. Uncover new resources and battle against new foes with ground units like the Armoroids, Bots and Drones. Super-extend space troops into their newly designed Ex-edition counterparts. Create your unique battleship extensions.  Some say nobody has what it takes to rule over space. Maybe they just haven\\u2019t found the right allies.   # # # Experience large-scale fleet-vs-fleet space battles featuring 100+ spacecrafts  Gone are the days you live your life in the cockpit engaging in dogfight combats like those in Galactic Phantasy Prelude and the Galaxy on Fire series. Now is the time to step up as Commander-in-Chief, look at the big picture, plan for your fleet formation and design your very own tactics to beat your enemies in enormous-scale space battles. In the world of Over Space it is not uncommon to get involved in massive space encounters featuring over 100 spaceships, a scale never before seen on any mobile games.   # # # Create your own fleet formations and tactics  Good reflexes might be what counts most in one-on-one space combats, but you certainly need a little more than that when it comes to massive fleet to fleet space battles.  Design your very own fleet formation that suits your style. Get the best out of the armory your Tank Frigates offer, send in some agile Speeder Destroyers here and there to roam around and distract the enemy spacecrafts, or rely on the long attack range of your Ranger Cruisers. Mix and match among different spaceship classes. Align them into columns, squares, wedges, echelons, or even cluster groups to create your very own formation.   # # # Battle against fleets from real players online and offline  Who says youre alone in space? Put your best tactics to the test and see how they fare against fellow fleet commanders. Its no longer just about the raw power of the battleships. You might as well outclass your opponents with your unique formation and superior tactics. In fact, in Over Space you get even better rewarded when you deploy a relatively weaker fleet to defeat a stronger opponent by means of some outstanding strategies and tactics.   # # # Unlimited ship / crew combinations, endless tactical possibilities  Corvettes and Frigates are good. Destroyers and Cruisers are better. Yet nothing beats your own customized battleships with your self-created unique extension modules.   Your tactical options dont just stop there though. As you scout around and recruit some great talents they provide you with further opportunities to customize the way your battleships perform. Taking into account your very own taste and play style, it could be more of an art than a science to put them altogether and work out the one perfect setup for you, out of all those virtually unlimited possibilities.   # # # Game Features  - Form an alliance & rule over space - Explore the planets & engage in ground battles with your allies - Massive space battles featuring 100+ spaceships, a scale never before seen on any mobile games - Create your own fleet formations & tactics - Battle against fleets from real players online and offline - Unlimited ship / crew combinations, endless tactical possibilities with various upgrade paths & customizations - Ever-changing game world with dynamic planet environments - Massively multiplayer online space strategy (RPG + SLG) game  Facebook \\uff1ahttps://www.facebook.com/overspace.gp2', Developer: 'Moonfish Software Limited', Age_Rating: '17+', Size: 427601920, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/battle-cards-savage-heroes/id1233200116', Name: 'Battle Cards - Savage Heroes', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/a8/f1/d4/a8f1d414-4552-11eb-2ea8-b0ba664abc73/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'A card battle game that is all about collecting awesome cards from various card packs, building competitive decks and fighting your opponents in a compelling campaign set in a real world wildlife setting.

When 3 or more balls of the same color and number are connected, the points on the balls are multiplied by 10. Players can boost their score by connecting multiple combos, in which case the combo points are multiplied by the number of combos hit so far (e.g. on the third combo, the points are multiplied by 3). The player can connect balls freely: vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Although the rules are simple\\u2014just connect 3 or more balls of the same color and number\\u2014Dual Match 3 is unique in that scores vary greatly depending on the connection path.  In Hard Mode, cubes containing the total number of points from connected balls appear in the position where the finger is removed. When 3 or more cubes of the same color are connected, you win the points and the cubes are removed. The level finishes when all color targets are cleared within the given number of moves. When you level up, bonus points are added based on the number of remaining moves, so you can boost your score by completing the level in fewer moves. At the end of the game, players receive coins according to the number of levels completed. These coins can be exchanged for items during the game. There are three items: Item 1: Tap a ball to remove it Item 2: Add two moves Item 3: Display a hint (reveals a high-scoring path) You can use items multiple times during a game, but the number of coins consumed doubles with each use.  In Time Mode, you have to get the high score within 60 seconds. When you hit the score target in 60 seconds, the level finishes and the time limit is reset to 60 seconds. Get combos to extend the time limit based on the number of combos you make. 1 combo adds 1 second, 2 combos add 3 seconds, 3 combos add 10 seconds, 4 combos add 30 seconds, and 5 combos add 60 seconds. However, the time limit never exceeds 60 seconds.  You can share in-game videos via SNS by pressing the record button during the game. You can also post your game results or best move to SNS. When you select a ball, it becomes hidden behind your finger, so the game uses haptic feedback to tell you when a ball is selected. People who cannot see differences in color can play using patterns with the \\u201cColorblind\\u201d option. There are three different color themes: 1. White 2. Dark blue 3. Gray  Dual Match 3 is optimized for iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, 11-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

But the delivery time from factory to customer is too long and therefore the player must use storage space to temporarily store the casks of beer.   Which strategy will the player choose? More casks with high costs for storage or less casks with higher penalty costs. Maybe the player wants to use a central warehouse, or are the casks stored locally? The player must also create contracts with the customer to generate some extra, much needed, income. But this will off course add an obligation to the player in which he or she has to deliver.  The player can lose the game if all his or her funds are depleted. This can happen if the player fails to deliver in time or has too many cask of beer in stock. Not achieving the goals set in the contract will result in penalty\\u2019s which, eventually will cost a lot of money and might force the player into bankruptcy.

Major corporations began to remove their human employees in favor of these advanced AI workers.  With so many humans unable to earn an income, the markets for nearly consumer good ground to a halt.

The sentient robots who managed these companies now roam the streets, growing more eccentric and demented as time passes.  There is one product that robots could never get right:  Ramen.   Through a cyber exploit, you have been able to obtain a coveted Ramen-Ya business license. Do not let it go to waste. Prove that organic humans still have a place in this world!

It was on Friday the 13th, a particularly cold day in October when he made a discovery that would change his life forever. He had entered a local Haunted House and discovered that all of the electrical circuits for every room in the house had been tampered with.  Jason always enjoyed tinkering with electronics, so when he repaired the electrical circuit the light turned on in the room. He immediately felt the presence of the spirits in the room disappear, as if their need to walk between the planes of existence had been lifted.  After turning on the lights in all of the rooms of the Haunted House, Jason felt the overwhelming feeling of despair lifted as the house was cleared of its ghostly inhabitants.

This is the oldest form of a Greek board game in history.  Ancient Greeks called Petteia any game played with pillars. The first reference is made in Homer\\u2019s work, and according to Athimaios in the Odyssey, where Homer refers to Penelope\\s lazy contenders as playing the petteia. In addition, the well-known professor of archeology, Alexandros Rizos Ragavis, considers petteia to be one of the three main homeric games. Nevertheless, there are few surviving passages referring to this game.  According to the resources, inventor of the game is Palamidis, who invented it when the Greek fleet was in Avlida waiting to leave for Troy or during the siege of Troy. Also, Euripides shows Palamidis playing this game with Protesilaos. Petteia was played either for mere pleasure or for profit. As an intelectual game it was highly appreciated because it exerted the sharpness of the players, while Plato\\s the knowledge offered was considered by Plato as equal to accounting, arithmetics and geometry.  In addition, there is the notion that, apart from being a strategy game, it was a game of clairvoyance. An example is the use of Achilles and Aia (a relative ancient Greek black-figure amphora of 450 BC, which is now housed in a state museum in Berlin), who played petteia trying to guess about the fall of Troy. This game was dear to the aristocracy, which had spare time to play this game, but also to other social groups such as warriors, convicts, exiles, elders, etc.  The game was widely accepted by the Romans, who enthralled it with passion. Indeed, they had improved it and developed it into a high intellectual game. They called it lactus latruncularum or lantruculi. The Byzantines took it from the Romans and they developed it into the chess game. In Byzantium, however, the petteia was often identified with the other dice games, because they used cubes to move the pawns. Thus, very easily from an intellectual game it was transformed into a game of gambling.  --- http://seikilo.com ---', Developer: 'Apostolos Giokas', Age_Rating: '4+', Size: 86242304, Original_Release_Date: '2008-7-11', Current_Version_Release_Date: '2017-5-30' }, { Url_Game: 'https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blocks-by-soin/id1249866295', Name: 'Blocks by SoIn', Subtitle: 'Not Subtitle', Icon_Url: 'https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple127/v4/03/f2/ce/03f2ce17-f3ba-133d-d1fa-52a98f767b01/source/512x512bb.jpg', Description: 'In Blocks players controls a blue block that\\u2019s followed by a red block.
